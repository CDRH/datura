## Prepare Index and Schema

### Step 1: Config

The following instructions are for Elasticsearch ONLY.  TODO points at the Solr schema instructions on the General Wiki once it is released.

You will need to make sure that somewhere, the following are being set in your public / private / global configs:

- es_path
- es_index

`es_type` used to be required for elasticsearch, but since elasticsearch 6 the type is always `_doc` by default, and you need not worry about it!

### Step 2: Prepare Elasticsearch Index

Make sure elasticsearch is installed and running in the location you wish to push to.  If there is already an index you will be using, take note of its name and skip this step. (Note that each index must be dedicated to data on one version of the API schema)  If you want to add an index, run this command with a specified environment:

```
admin_es_create_index -e development
```

Optionally, if you want to manually set your schema and make sure that everything is shipshape, you can run the following command.  Note that the schema is set automatically before posting every time the script is run.

```
es_set_schema [-e environment]
```

You may run the above as many times as you wish, as long as you have not already put items in the index which will conflict with the fieldtypes.  This would happen, for example, if you added fields which had no type specified.  ES will guess at the correct fieldtypes and doesn't usually get everything right.

_If you are adding new fields (which are not _k, _t, _d fields), you MUST add them to the schema._

The schema will be automatically set each time you run the `post` script.
