## [Unreleased](https://github.com/CDRH/datura/compare/v0.2.0-beta...dev)

### Added
- minor test for Datura::Helpers.date_standardize

### Changed
- data_standardize now relies on strftime instead of manual zero padding for month, day

## [v0.2.0-beta](https://github.com/CDRH/datura/compare/v0.1.6...v0.2.0-beta) - 2020-08-17 - Altering field and xpath behavior, adds get_elements

### Added
- Fields (and therefore methods) for ES JSON, such as extent, alternative, spatial, etc
- Methods to xToES format fields to accommodate default behavior
- ES JSON `uri` now populated using default Orchid item path
- Tests and fixtures for all supported formats except CustomToEs
- `get_elements` returns nodeset given xpath arguments
- `spatial` nested fields `spatial.type` and `spatial.title`

### Changed
- Arguments for `get_text`, `get_list`, and `get_xpaths`
- XPaths for VRA and TEI to Elasticsearch
- Default behavior for CsvToEs for some fields
- Documentation updated
- Changed Install instructions to include RVM and gemset naming conventions
- API field `coverage_spatial` is now just `spatial`

### Migration
- Change `coverage_spatial` nested field to `spatial`
- `get_text`, `get_list`, and `get_xpaths` require changing arguments to keyword (like `xml` and `keep_tags`)
- Recommend checking xpaths and behavior of fields after updating to this version, as some defaults have changed
- Possible to refactor previous FileCsv overrides to use new CsvToEs abilities, but not necessary

## [v0.1.6](https://github.com/CDRH/datura/compare/v0.1.5...v0.1.6) - 2020-04-24 - Improvements to CSV, WEBS transformers and adds Custom transformer

### Added
- CsvToEs class added which imitates style of other XToEs classes for easier overriding / maintenance
- Custom formats now supported, although no functionality provided since the type of format cannot be predicted
- Adds documentation for custom format setup

### Changed
- CSV to ES transformation no longer accepts default column names, but instead looks for columns matching ES fields to use
- FileType elasticsearch transform now has swappable component when reading
XML-type files. Webscraping script altered to manipulate HTML instead of
XML object type

### Removed
- CSV to ES transformation used to automatically assume columns as ES fields, this functionality has been removed
