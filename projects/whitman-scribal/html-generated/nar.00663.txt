            Hon. R. S. Field,
            Judge of the U. S. District Court,
            Princeton, N. J.
            Sir:
            I am directed by the Attorney General to transmit you a commission appointing Charles R. Cornwell to be U. S. Marshal for the District of New Jersey—and to request that you will deliver it to him when he shall have given the official bond, and taken the oath required by law.
            Very respectfully, yours,
            W. F. Peddrick,
            Clerk.
