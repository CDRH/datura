            Hon. Wm. W. Belknap,
            Secretary of War.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to acknowledge the receipt of your letter of the 11th instant, submitting a communication to the Adjutant General from A. Hyde, Superintendent of the National Cemetery at Fort Scott, Kansas, stating that suit has been brought against him by on Bledsoe, for an alleged debt arising under a contract made in his official character. Mr. Hyde does not distinctly request that the District Attorney shall be directed to defend the suit, and he appears to be already provided with counsel of his own selection. But such I suppose to be the object of his communication—and accordingly I have directed the District Attorney of Kansas to aid in the defence if he desires it.
            Very respectfully, &amp;c.
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            U.S. Cemetery Supt. case
            Kansas
