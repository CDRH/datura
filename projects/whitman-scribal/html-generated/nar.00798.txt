            Ward H. Lamon, Esq.
            Washington, D. C.
            Sir:
            I am in receipt of your note relative to the case of The U. S. vs. Higdon, No. 198, on appeal from the Court of Claims. On Saturday last, I advised the Secretary of War that this appeal might be dismissed, without prejudice to the interests of the U. S.—In this class of cases I am in the habit of awaiting the consent of the Secretary of War to the dismissal of the appeal, before taking action in the cases.
            Yours very truly
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
