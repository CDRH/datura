            J. N. Robinson, Esq.
            Forrest Hill,
            Gratiot Co, Mich.
            Sir:
            I have received yours of the 17th instant, with its enclosures.—Such papers come almost daily to this office. It seems that some dishonest people are operating upon a large scale from New York.
            So far as our discoveries have hitherto gone, it appears that the real purpose is not to circulate counterfeit money, but to swindle those to whom they send their circulars. However, we have put such papers in the hands of the officers who have charge of the detective system, and hope they may succeed in tracing out the villainy.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            attempted swindling.
