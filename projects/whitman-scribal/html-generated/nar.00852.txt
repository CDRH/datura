            Hon. Geo. L. Boutwell,
            Secretary of the Treasury.
            Sir:
            I have the honor to enclose herewith a number of papers respecting the settlement of the acc't of Jos. Laughlin, late a lieutenant of Volunteers, accompanied by a letter from him of the 18th inst., in which it has been alleged that a fraud has been committed by his agent upon the government,—and to suggest that they be referred to the Second Comptroller for investigation.
            Very Resp. yours,
            E. R. Hoar,
            Attorney General.
