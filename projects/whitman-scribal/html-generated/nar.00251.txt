            Hon. H. T. Backus,
            Associate Justice, &amp;c.
            Tucson, Arizona Terr.
            Sir:
            The Attorney General directs me to inform you that he will be unable to comply with your request for leave of absence, as made in your letter in September 21.
            Complaints from the Territories on account of the absence of the U. S. judges have been so numerous and pressing that he is compelled to such refusal.
            Very respectfully,
            Your obd't serv't,
            F. U. Stitt,
            Acting Ch. Clerk.
