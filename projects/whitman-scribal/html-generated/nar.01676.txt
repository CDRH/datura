            Winchester, Va.
            Sir:
            I have received your letter of the 28th ultimo, and in reply inform you that the rule of this Department has always been to consider all papers filed in support of applications for official positions as the property of the Government, and not to be returned. I must therefore decline to return your papers, as requested.
            Very respectfully,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
            
            return of papers declined.
