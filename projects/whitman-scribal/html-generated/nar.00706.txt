            Wm. Schouler, Esq,
            Boston, Mass.
            Sir:
            The Secretary of War, to whom I referred your letter of the 10th instant, asking that the case of Hosmer, v. the United States, might be advanced upon the calendar, so as to be heard at the next term of the Supreme Court,—has informed me that such action does not appear to him to be called for by the public interest, and that he is not prepared, under such circumstances, to advise or consent thereto.
            Very respectfully yours,
            Wm. M. Evarts,
            Attorney General.
