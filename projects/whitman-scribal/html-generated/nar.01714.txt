            The President,
            Sir:
            The enclosed application of Mr. Haskins for a military cadetship for his son, has been referred to me by your order. I think that this reference must have been made by mistake, as this Department has no connection with such appointments; and therefore I respectfully return the application.
            With great respect, I am, Sir,
            Your obd't serv't,
            A. T. Akerman,
            Attorney General.
