   <head type="sub">John G. Neihardt correspondents</head>
   <p>Neihardt’s professional literary correspondence includes exchange with figures of national and international importance and as such provides direct evidence of his wide-ranging and inclusive intellectual relationships.   In the first few decades after Frederick Jackson Turner declared the American frontier “closed,” Neihardt’s list of correspondents represents another kind of open space ready to be explored &#8212; an extensive network of adventurous and diverse minds eager to share knowledge and information across many kinds of educational, political and social boundaries and differences of religion, race, gender, and geographical region.</p>

  <note>Born in Kentucky, author of 36 books and nearly 3,000 poems; known as the Keats of Kentucky for his Romantic evocation of natural world.  Earning an international reputation, Edmund Gosse selected the verse and wrote the introduction to his collection, Kentucky Poems; his work was recognized by Pres. Theodore Roosevelt with an invitation to the White House (1905); his friendships included Kate Chopin, E. A. Robinson, Oliver Wendell Holmes.
    
    In 1913, he published a poem entitled “Waste Land” in Poetry magazine in an issue that also contained an essay by Ezra Pound.  Said to have influenced T. S. Eliot’s 1922 work, “The Waste Land,” (which is often identified as the beginning of modernist poetry), Cawein’s work also drew deeply upon Anglo-European literary allusion and classical mythology.  Unlike Eliot, however, he wrote in traditional verse form.</note>

  <note>Raised on a farm in upstate New York, he graduated from Cornell with a degree in botany and attended graduate school at Butler University and the University of Indiana School of Medicine. Emulating Louis Agassiz, he studied ichthyology and taught natural history, writing over half a dozen scientific texts on fish and discovering over two thousand species, becoming one of the foremost American experts on fish.   He joined the faculty of the University of Indiana in natural history in 1879 and was named president in 1885 (the nation’s youngest at the time).  In 1891, upon the recommendation of Andrew White, then President of Cornell, he became first President of the newly established Stanford University.
    
    In addition to his work in education and administration, he was a peace activist who opposed war (for evolutionary reasons to preserve the genetic diversity) and served as president of the World Peace Foundation and World Peace Conference.  He testified as an expert witness for the defense in the Scopes Trial and worked with the ACLU to raise funds for Scopes’ defense.  He was also a member of the Bohemian Club and served as a Director of the Sierra Club.  He was a trustee of the Human Betterment Foundation, an organization that distributed information about eugenics, especially legislation regarding forced sterilization (he did not support the radical implications of eugenics).</note>

  <note>26th President of the U. S., leader of Progressive Movement, whose history of military and  political involvement (war in Cuba, Rough Riders, Bull Moose Party etc.) is well-documented.   He developed a love of nature and outdoor adventure and activity as a child recovering from poor health and asthma.  Widowed at a young age, he ranched in the Badlands of South Dakota and later, North Dakota, and became well-known as an outdoorsman who championed the conservation movement, adding to national forests and setting aside lands for public use.  He was also, however, a big-game hunter who took thousands of animals as specimens, with little benefit to science.
    
    Author of over thirty books, he kept up an enormous correspondence with contemporary intellectuals, political figures, family and friends.</note>

  <note>American lyric poet, first woman to win the Pulitzer Prize for poetry (in 1918, when it was known as the Columbia University Poetry Society Prize).  Born in St. Louis, MO, she frequently traveled to Chicago where she became associated with the Chicago Renaissance and the literary circle forming around Poetry magazine.  Best known for her use of traditional poetic form when others were experimenting with free verse, it was there that she met the poet, Vachal Lindsay who fell in love with her.  Since he could not support her, however, she wed Ernst Filsinger, later divorcing him. She then renewed her friendship with Lindsay (by this time married with a family).  Two years after his suicide, she took her own life as well.</note>
