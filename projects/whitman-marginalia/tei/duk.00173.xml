                                to know that such a man as <choice><orig>Shakspere</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice> was created than to
                                be familiar with the shelves of whole libraries of dusty
                                tomes. The advent of a soul so richly gifted, of a nature so
                                intensely ideal and so richly passionate, is an era in the
                                history of man. No poet ever reached a <choice><sic>hight</sic><corr>height</corr></choice> so lofty,
                                described so  grandly, speculated so daringly, or felt so

                                effect. His grandest thoughts flow so naturally, that it is
                                easy to see that they are familiar and accustomed to his

                                of himself. Hamlet and Mercutio, Macbeth and Romeo,

                                each and all bear the impress of having originated from
                                the same mind. There is probably less known of <choice><orig>Shakspere</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>
                                personally than of any man of mark in English history.
                                He lived in an age of heroes, and he was a foremost man
                                among them. His contemporaries bowed before his
                                master spirit, and the most colossal minds of all Europe
                                have acknowledged his sovereignty. And yet we have a
                                better knowledge of men who died a thousand years ago,
                                before printing perpetuated tradition, when chroniclers
                                were few, than of this wondrous man. There is not, we
                                have reason to think, a single letter of his writing preserved,
                                and scarcely a contemporary anecdote. There
                                are portraits not one of which can be proved to be authentic;
                                a bust which seems genuine, but cannot be warranted.
                                This man, the real spiritual king of England, is in his individuality
                                as much a myth as Homer. But this we do
                                know, a man there lived whose intellectual and moral
                                nature was a microcosm which embraced the ideal of humanity,
                                and that he left behind a hundred representatives

                                and scarf. A man in a black velvet cloak,
                                heralded by a trumpet, has before this entered as Prologue.
                                Such is <choice><orig>Shakspeare</orig><reg>Shakespeare</reg></choice>'s stage. On the boards at

            <p>a paper read by William Henry
            Smith, author of "Was Lord Bacon
            the author of Shakespeare's Plays?"
            &#8212;"What Pope says of some of the Plays
            of Shakespeare is probably <del rend="overstrike">of</del> true of
            all&#8212;that they were pieces of unknown
            authors, or fitted up for the <choice><orig>theatre</orig><reg>theater</reg></choice>
            while under his administration,&#8212;revised
            and added to by him."</p>
            <p>It seems according to Malone
            that "the London Prodigal" was
            acted at his <choice><orig>theatre</orig><reg>theater</reg></choice> and afterwards
            printed with his <add rend="insertion, underline" place="supralinear">Shakespeare's</add> name on the
            title page&#8212;and, though he had
            never written a line of it he
            was indifferent to the cheat
            and to the printer's impudence.
            &#8212;Bacon, according to W.H. Smith,
            was most probably the <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear">real</add> author
            &#8212;he goes on with his reasons
            <choice><sic>therefor</sic><corr>therefore</corr></choice>, some of them very curious
            and plausible, especially a <add rend="unmarked" place="supralinear">contemporary</add>

            <p>Many little things are too much
            overcolored, in Shakespeare&#8212;<hi rend="underline" hand="#h2">far too
            much.</hi>&#8212; The features of beloved women, <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear"><handShift new="#h2"/>compliments,</add>

            hundreds more, are painted too intensely.
            It is no answer to this, to say that
            a lover would so state the case
            about a woman he loved, or that
            a strong rich nature would be
            apt to describe incidents in that
            manner; and <subst><add rend="insertion" place="supralinear" seq="2" hand="#h2"><handShift new="#h2"/>that</add> <del rend="overstrike" seq="1" hand="#h2"><handShift new="#h1"/>therefore</del></subst> Shakespeare
            is <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear" hand="#h2"><handShift new="#h2"/>therefore</add> <handShift new="#h1"/>correct in so presenting them.&#8212;
            Immensely too much is unnaturally
            colored&#8212;the sentiment is piled
            on, similes, compar<subst><del rend="overwrite" seq="1">a</del><add rend="overwrite" place="over" seq="2">i</add></subst>sons, defiances,

            great and little characters are
            glaringly inappropriate, both words
            and sentiments such as could not
            have come from their mouths, <add rend="insertion" place="supralinear" hand="#h2"><handShift new="#h2"/>in real life</add> <handShift new="#h1"/> and

            occasion the character and action are
            perfect.&#8212; This is what saves Shakespeare
            &#8212;Is he imitative of Homer? If so, where and how?</p></div1>
