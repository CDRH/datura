            <p>In May, 1953, Mr. Oscar Lion presented to The New York Public Library a portion, and
                deposited there the remainder, of his remarkable collection of books, letters and
                manuscripts by or about Walt Whitman. Brought together during some thirty-five years
                of enthusiastic collecting, Mr. Lion's Whitmaniana totals over five hundred pieces,
                some of which are of great rarity and significance for the study of Whitman's life
                and writing. This catalog describes only those items deemed poetry and/or prose manuscripts.</p>
            <!--
<p>It would be difficult, for example, to exaggerate the interest and importance of what is undoubtedly the "star" piece of the collection, Whitman's own copy of the second issue of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>, prefaced with quotations from reviews. This volume is one of the few copies extant in paper covers, the upper cover lettered simply with the title. On this cover Whitman has written in ink and pencil:

<blockquote>
<p>2d &amp; fullest version of original edition 1855-'56 (the 1st edition consisted of the Poems alone - some months afterwards the extracts &amp;c prefacing the text as here, were added - making this edition)</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Horace L. Traubel has also inscribed on the upper cover a note concerning this copy, headed by his signature and the date, 1892:
<blockquote>
<p>Whitman made several searches for this volume during his lifetime, I assisting him, but we never could turn it up. It was his intention that I should take &amp; preserve it. At his death I found it, crushed &amp; torn, in an old box, packed close with old mss &amp; books. H.L.T.
 </p></blockquote></p>
 
<p>The covers of the Lion copy (one of thre in pink or green paper covers located by Clifton J. Furness in his introduction to the Facsimile Text Society edition, 1939) are at present an indistinct shaed of tan which seems more likely to have fadeded from an original pink than from green as Furness conjectured. The upper cover, with Whitman's and Traubel's inscriptions, is reproduced in the 1939 facsimile edition, as well as in <title  render="italic">Walt Whitman's Workshop</title>, edited by Furness (Cambridge, 1928).</p></blockquote></p>
 
<p>Pasted and pinned to the blank flyleaves of the book are seven different manuscript versions of introductions intended for American editions of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>. These holograph manuscripts, in ink and pencil, were worked over and revised at various times between the first appearance of the book in 1855 and May 31, 1870, the date of Whitman's fifty-first birthday. Sometime after that date the volume with its attached manuscripts was packed away and lost sight of for some twenty years (as indicated in Traubel's inscription quoted above), and the introductions were never published during Whitman's lifetime. They do appear, reprinted with notes and facsimiles of some leaves, in <title render="italic">Walt Whitman's Workshop</title>, a <title render="italic">Collection of Unpublished Manuscripts. Edited . . . by Clifton Joseph Furness</title> (Cambridge, Harvard University Press, 1928). According to Furness, "the manuscripts as they stand are the result of many years of reflection and revision. Their composition dates from the period of the poet's prime activity, the time when the greater bulk of poems which brought him enduring fame were being conceived, drafted, revised. . . . The number of different completed drafts of the same material with many variant readings, in these manuscripts, is the most complete revelation possible of the painstaking method by which Whitman strove to perfect the working out of his thought. Every page is filled with superimposed revisions, crossed-out words, and interlinear additions, in diferent styles of writing, ink, or pencil, which show how often Whitman must have gone through this material to shape it completely to his intent."</p>
 
<p>Of nearly as much significance as Whitman's copy of the 1855 <title render="italic">Leaves</title> is his copy of the Boston, 1860-61 edition, the famous <title render="quoted">Blue Book.</title> It is this volume, in blue paper wrappers, which was discovered in Whitman's desk by Secretary of the Interior Harlan, leading to his dismissal from the Department on June 30, 1865. Documenting this even in Whitman's life in Washington, the Lion Collection also includes a group of seven letters and documents relating to his work in the Departments of the Interior and Treasury. Among these are Secretary Harlan's letter of dismissal, and a memorandum in Whitman's hand recording a conversation with W. T. Otto of the Interior Department about the finding of the <title render="quoted">Blue Book</title> in Whitman's desk.</p>
 
<p>The book itself, possibly the only known copy in contemporary wrappers, uncut, is heavily corrected and revised throughout in Whitman's hand, in preparation for later editions. It is another remarkable example of his lifelong habit of editing and rewriting his poems. The flyleaf is inscribed:
<blockquote>
<p>Property of Horace L. Traubel. Received from Walt Whitman May 23d 1890 - W. saying: "You fellows value these curios more than I do. This will help you to see how the book grew, if that is anything. But I guess you would know how it grew if you never possessed the book. The book is a milepost . . . This gives a glimpse into the work shop . . ."</p></blockquote></p>
<p>Of the so-called <title render="quoted">Death Bed Edition</title> of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title> (Philadelphia, David McKay, 1891-2), the Lion collection has three copies in wrappers. One is the earliest issue, bound uncut in dark brown wrappers, with a yellow printed label on the spine. This copy is inscribed: "The rejected cover Dec 1891 Horace L. Traubel: and is accompanied by a letter from Mrs. Traubel to Mr. Lion, dated October 4th, 1927, which reads in part: 
<blockquote>
<p>There are three copies of the brown stone front. Two inscribed alike - one you have. I have the other, as well as the copy with no inscription.</p>
<p>I used to be audacious. I remember the evening Horace came home with these volumes. He showed me two &amp; asked what I thought of them. "They look like Philadelphia brown stone front houses." He was displeased with that outspoken young lady and repeated the phrase to Whitman. "Look respectable eh?" he asked mildly. Later I saw them in the rough gray paper which I like very much.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>The two copies in the grey wrappers are from a small number inteded for presentation, some of which Whitman signed before his death. One of the Lion copies is inscribed in Whitman's name by Traubel to George M. Williamson, January 7, 1892; in the other Traubel has noted on the flyleaf that it was presented to Mrs. Traubel "Jan. 1892, from his sickbed."</p>
<p>The printed volumes in the Lion Collection include a very comprehensive sequence of the various editions of Whitman's published writings, from <title inline="true" render="italic">Franklin Evans</title> as it originally appeared in <title inline="true" render="italic">The New World</title>, November, 1842, to the 1950 publication: <title inline="true" render="italic">Walt Whitman of the New York Aurora, editor at Twenty-Two.</title> Besides Whitman's own copy of the second issue of <title inline="true" render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>, described above, the collection contains a fine example of the first issue, and a second copy of the second issue in the original binding, from Buxton Forman's library. The second edition of 1856 is represented by Horace Greeley's copy, later owned by Joel Benton.</p>
<p>There are presentation copies from Whitman of several of his first editions. A fine copy of the rare first issue of <title inline="true" render="italic">Drum-taps</title> (New York, 1865), formerly in the William F. Gable collection, includes a full-page inscription by Whitman:
<blockquote>
<p>To my friend, Mrs. Johnston - accept a copy of my little book <title inline="true" render="italic">Drum Taps.</title> Many of the pieces were written in camp, on the field, or in the Army Hospitals, under strange &amp; sad surroundings. Walt Whtiman Camden, N. J. Nov. 9, 1873.</p></blockquote></p>
<p>A copy of <title inline="true" render="italic">Passage to India</title> (1871) was given to Traubel in 1889, "Received," as Traubel has written on the flyleaf, "from Walt Whitman one stormy (rainy) ev'g, on my way home, April 27, Saturday, 1889 - and a calm beautiful hour spent there with him." <title inline="true" render="italic">As a Strong Bird on Pinions Free</title> (1872) was presented to Sadakichi Hartmann in 1884, and a copy of <title inline="true" render="italic">Memoranda During the War</title> (1875) is inscribed by the author to Walter S. Crispin on the end paper, not on the printed presentation leaf, as in most known presentation copies of this book. A copy of the 1888 <title inline="true" render="italic">November Boughs</title>, presented to Anne Montgomerie on October 28th of that year, has laid in it a proof printing of <title inline="true" render="quoted">As the Greek's Signal Flame</title> which diffes textually from the version as printed in the book.</!
p>
<p>An interesting associaton volume is Whitman's copy of the Harper's Classical Library edition of <title inline="true" render="italic">The Works of Virgil</title> (New York, 1857). The book has Whitman's signature on the title page and his woodcut name label on the inside front cover. On the front flyleaves hea has written two slightly vrying inscriptions, one in pencil and the other in purple ink, explaining that the dark stains on the edges of the book were caused by "breaking a bottle of Virginia wine in my satchel during a jaunt war-time 1863." The book was presented to Mr. Lion by Anne Montgomerie Traubel, March 29, 1929.</p>
<p>The collection includes many translations, particularly of <title inline="true" render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>, into Catalan, Danish, Dutch, French, German, Italian, Japanese, Russian, Swedish and Yiddish. The section of books and pamphlets about Whitman's life and poetry numbers nearly two hundred items, constituting in itself an abundant source of information on his career and on his position and influence in the development of American poetry.</p>
<scopecontent><head>Manuscripts</head>
<p>A notable feature of the Lion Collection is the group of manuscripts and letters. Two of the most important items are a notebook of twelve pages containing the first sketches and drafts for Whitman's long poem, <title inline="true" render="italic">Passage to India</title>; and a later manuscript of the complete poem which falls in between the sketch book and the final printer's manuscript now in the Amy Lowell Collection at Harvard. With the complete manuscript are a few of the rare trail printings of portions of the poem.</p>
<p>A small notebook of twenty-three pages, dating from about 1854, contains prose notes and suggestions for poems, some of which were used in different form in the 1855 <title inline="true" render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>. This notebook, which Emory Holloway designates as "Manuscript Notebook 4A," was published with Holloway's notes in <title inline="true" render="italic">The American Mercury</title> for December, 1924.</p>
<p>Mention has already been made above of the collection of seven letters and documents dating from January 12, 1865, to March 10, 1873, relating to Whitman's career in Washington in the Interior and Treasury Departments. Mementos of his services as a volunteer nurse in the army hospitals in Washington during the Civil War are to be found in a volume containing fifteen notes, jotted on scraps of paper at the bedsides of wounded soilders. These give names, home addresses and other particulars concerning the soilders and were used by Whitman in writing letters to their families and friends, or as the basis for passages in his <title inline="true" render="italic">Memoranda During the War</title> (1875). The brief jottings, with similar ones from other sources, are printed in the sections entitled "Hospital Cases" and "Hospital Incidents" in <title inline="true" render="italic">Walt Whitman and the Civil War . . . Edited by Charles J. G.ickberg</title> (Philadelphia, 1933). Whit!
man's long and devoted service in the hostpitals during the War was later recognized by Congress when it voted him an invalid pension in 1887.</p>
<p>There are several autograph letters by Whitman including a fine series of eleven letters to his mother written from Washington between February 19 and May 13, 1873, while he was recuperating from a serious illness of that winter. These letters, with others of the same period, were published in <title inline="true" render="italic">In Re Walt Whitman: Edited by His Literary Executors</title> (1893), in a section entitled "Letters in Sickness: Washington, 1873."</p>
<p>Probably the finest single letter in the collection is one dated January 10, 1873, to William Michael Rossetti, the editor of the London, 1868, edition of <title inline="true" render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>. It is present in two forms, the original draft with numerous alterations and corrections, and the letter as sent to Rossetti. In it Whitman alludes to the indifference to his work in the United States, and to the interest and appreciation shown by English authors such as Swinburne, Tennyson, Symonds, Dowden, and others, and goes on to describe his life in Washington, his work, and his dismissal by Secretary Harlan.</p>
<p>The collection also contains two letters by Peter Doyle, Whitman's closest friend in Washington. Doyle letters are particularly rare. These two, dated October 5 and 9, 1868, were penciled on the horse cars at night while Doyle was on duty, and give Whitman news of Washington and of other friends of his in the city.</p>
<p>The Library is honored to have been chosen custodian of this fine Whitman collection. Its resources add notable strength and luster to the Library's holdings of this American poet's books and manuscripts already in the general collection, in the Reserve and Manuscript Divisions, and in the wll known W. T. H. Howe collection now part of the Berg Collection. It is perhaps not inappropriate that these books and manuscripts should be placed at the corner of Fifth Avenue and 42nd Street for the use of students of Walt Whitman, "lover of populous pavements, Dweller in Manhattan, my city."</p>

                                are two prose notes, the first about the frequent meanness of men of
                                high social standing and the second about the wisdom of keeping
                                "clean inside and out." The leaf was formerly cut between the
                                verso-side notes, probably by Whitman, and has been rejoined.<!-- At the point that we write EAD entries for unpublished prose, both of the scraps on the verso will receive their own EAD entries (they are WWA IDs nyp.00523 and nyp.00524). KM --></p>

                             <p>Revised draft of the poem <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Passage to India,</title> first published in a small volume of the same name in <date normal="1871" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1871</date>. It was later included as a supplement to the second issue of the <date normal="1871" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1871</date> edition of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>.  At some point before <extref linktype="simple" actuate="onrequest" href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/tei/har.00036.html" show="new"><date normal="1870-03-15" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">March 15, 1870</date></extref>, Whitman had an early draft of the poem set in print by Andrew and Thomas Rome (the printers of the <date normal="1855" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1855</date> edition of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>). Whitman then used the printed pages to make edits and corrections, which he subsequently sent to publisher J.S. Redfield, who ultimately printed the finished book. Since this particular draft contains portions of the printed poem pasted onto the manuscript pages, it most likely dates from after <date normal="1870-03" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">March 1870</date>. At the repository, the draft is accompanied by a typewritten memorandum by Emory Holloway, as well as typewritten letters from Amy Lowell and Clifton Joseph Furness to Oscar Lion; images of these items are not available.
                                <!--There is also a typed copy of the autograph manuscript of this poem in the Amy Lowell Collection at Harvard University, and other printed ephemera bearing on the provenance of this draft.--></p>

                            <p>Of nearly as much significance as Whitman's copy of the 1855 <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Leaves</title> is his copy of
                                the Boston, <date normal="1860/1861" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1860-61</date> edition, the famous <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Blue Book.</title> It is this volume, in blue
                                paper wrappers, that was discovered in Whitman's desk by Secretary
                                of the Interior James Harlan, leading to Whitman's dismissal from the
                                Department on <date normal="1865-06-30" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">June 30, 1865</date>. Documenting this event in Whitman's
                                life in Washington, the Lion Collection also includes a group of
                                seven letters and documents relating to his work in the Departments
                                of the Interior and Justice. Among these are Secretary Harlan's
                                letter of dismissal, and a memorandum in Whitman's hand recording a
                                conversation with W. T. Otto of the Department of the Interior about the
                                finding of the <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Blue
                                    Book</title> in Whitman's desk; images of these items are unavailable.</p>
                             
                            <p>The book itself is heavily corrected and revised throughout in
                                Whitman's hand, in preparation for later editions, though in fact Whitman never implemented many of the changes he contemplated. The <title render="doublequote">Blue Book</title> is another remarkable example of his lifelong habit of editing and rewriting his poems. The flyleaf is inscribed: "Property of Horace L. Traubel / Received from Walt Whitman <date normal="1890-05-23" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">May 23d 1890</date>&#8212;W. saying: 'You fellows value these curios more than I do.
                                This will help you to see how the book grew, if that is anything.
                                But I guess you would know how it grew if you never possessed the
                                book. The book is a milepost . . . This gives a glimpse into the
                                work shop . . .'"</p>

                    <p>Two cancelled drafts of a poem that was unpublished during Whitman's lifetime. It was published posthumously as <title render="doublequote">[Love is the cause of causes]</title> in the "Uncollected Poems" section of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass: Comprehensive Reader's Edition</title>, edited by Harold W. Blodgett and Sculley Bradley (<date normal="1965" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1965</date>). These manuscripts are part of a larger notebook, in which Whitman recorded a series of prose notes. The poetry drafts are surfaces 9 and 12. Edward Grier dates the notebook to 1854, citing the reference to the wreck of the <emph render="italic">San Francisco</emph> and the opening of "a marble church" in New York City (on the notebook's first page), which Emory Holloway identifies as the Marble Collegiate Church, both of which occurred in 1854 (see Grier, <title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</title> [New York: New York University Press, 1984] 1:128).</p>

                       <p>One of a series of draft introductions Whitman prepared for <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>, but which were never printed during his lifetime. This particular introduction, composed entirely in verse, was reworked and revised multiple times. Though <title render="doublequote">Inscription To the Reader at the entrance of Leaves of Grass</title> did not appear in print as a distinct and cohesive piece until collected by Clifton Joseph Furness in <title render="italic">Walt Whitman's Workshop</title> (<date normal="1928" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1928</date>), portions of this draft were distilled into <title render="doublequote">One's-self I Sing,</title> first published as <title render="doublequote">Inscription</title> in the <date normal="1867" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1867</date> edition of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>. Whitman revised this poem before including it as <title render="doublequote">One's-self I Sing</title> in <date normal="1871" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1871</date>, dropping some of the lines only to reintroduce them in <title render="doublequote">Sands at Seventy</title> (<date normal="1888" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1888</date>), under the title <title render="doublequote">Small the Theme of My Chant.</title> Both <title render="doublequote">One's-self I Sing</title> and <title render="doublequote">Small the Theme of My Chant</title> appeared in the <date normal="1891/1892" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1891-92</date> edition of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>.

                       <p>A manuscript fragment discussing the dangers of the "whip sting ray"&#8212;much "dreaded by fishermen" in the New York area. These prose notes bear no known relationship to Whitman's published works. However, at the top of the manuscript are cancelled lines which read: "and winrows are the green backed spotted mossbonkers . . . the fishermen stand in negligent ease, poised on their strong limbs&#8212;." Whitman used these cancelled lines, in slightly revised form, in the poem that would eventually be known as <title render="doublequote">A Paumanok Picture.</title> First published as part of <title render="doublequote">Poem of Salutation</title> in <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title> (<date normal="1856" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1856</date>), then as part of <title render="doublequote">Salut au Monde</title> in the <date normal="1860/1861" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1860&#8211;1861</date>, <date normal="1867" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1867</date>, and <date normal="1871/1872" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1871&#8211;1872</date> editions of <title render="italic">Leaves</title>; these lines were later extracted and published as a separate poem, <title render="doublequote">A Paumanok Picture,</title> in <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title> (<date normal="1881/1882" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1881&#8211;82</date> and <date normal="1891/1892" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1891&#8211;92</date>).

                            title "Live Oak Leaves" in late spring, 1859, and adopted calamus as his
                            symbol of manly love, the date must be earlier.</p>
