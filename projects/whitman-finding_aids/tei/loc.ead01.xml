            <p> The Thomas Biggs Harned Collection of the Papers of Walt Whitman spans the period
                    <date normal="1842/1937" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1842-1937</date>, with
                most of the items dated from <date normal="1855/1892" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                    >1855-1892</date>. The collection consists of Whitman's correspondence, poetry
                and prose manuscripts, notes and notebooks, proofs and offprints, printed matter,
                and miscellaneous supplementary items. A detailed description of the Harned
                Collection can be found in the Library of Congress publication <title
                    render="italic" linktype="simple">Walt Whitman: A Catalog</title> (<date
                    era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1955</date>), which contains an introductory essay
                on significant Whitman collectors and their collections and an annotated
                bibliographic listing of Whitman items then located among the collections of various
                divisions within the Library.</p>
            <p>Walt Whitman's papers were divided among his three literary executors, <persname
                    normal="Bucke, Richard Maurice, 1837-1902" source="lcnaf" encodinganalog="600$a"
                    >Richard M. Bucke</persname>, <persname normal="Harned, Thomas Biggs"
                    source="lcnaf" encodinganalog="600$a">Thomas Biggs Harned</persname>, and
                    <persname normal="Traubel, Horace, 1858-1919" source="lcnaf"
                    encodinganalog="600$a">Horace L. Traubel</persname>. Of these, only Harned's
                collection remains largely intact, the integrity of the other collections having
                been lost through dispersal. Whitman's personal habits were such that he wrote and
                collected his notes in a casual and unsystematic manner, entrusting his thoughts to
                scraps of paper, be it the back of a used envelope or the verso of a letter. His
                notebooks contain an equal number of random jottings, some no more than bits and
                pieces of paper sewn together to form a small notebook. These notes and notebooks
                include names and addresses, trial titles, trial lines of poetry and prose pieces,
                diary and hospital notes, pencil sketches and drawings, drafts of poems and essays,
                autobiographical and personal notes, printing and publishing notes, and
                miscellaneous notes on a wide range of subjects such as history, geography,
                politics, and ethnology. </p>
            <p> Poems and prose writings in the Manuscripts series vary in form from tentative
                outlines to final drafts. This material often shows the extensive revision
                characteristic of Whitman's composition. Related notes and notebook entries add
                details helpful for textual analysis of the poems. Whitman's practice of drafting
                letters, notes, and literary works on the back of incoming letters necessitates the
                identification of verso items in order to provide full documentation. </p>

            <p>Whitman had been greatly moved by <persname normal="Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865"

                for him the best in the American national character and who inspired some of his
                greatest poetry. He lectured extensively on <persname
                    normal="Lincoln, Abraham, 1809-1865" source="lcnaf" encodinganalog="600$a"
                    >Lincoln</persname>, and in a series of lectures given between <date era="ce"
                    calendar="gregorian">1879</date> and <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                    >1890</date>, he recalled details of <persname

                    >Lincoln's</persname> life and death and sketched an intimate profile based on
                personal reminiscence. The Lincoln Material series contains a thematic grouping of
                various types of manuscripts and printed matter concerning these lectures and
                related topics. </p>
            <p> The Proofs and Offprints series includes copies of Whitman's prose and poetry.
                Whitman often revised his writings after having them set in type, and several of the
                proofs in this series contain either corrections to the text or notations for the
                printer. </p>
            <p> In <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1942</date>, a group of Whitman notebooks
                from the Harned collection, along with other national treasures, were evacuated from
                Washington, D.C., for safekeeping during World War II. Upon the return of the
                material from storage in <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1944</date>, it was
                discovered that ten Whitman notebooks and a cardboard butterfly were missing. In
                    <date era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1995</date>, the Library regained custody of
                four of these notebooks and the butterfly, but six notebooks remain unaccounted
                for.</p>
            <p>The recovered items relate to Whitman's early career as a journalist and poet and
                include notes on perception and the senses, names and addresses, diary notes, drafts
                of Civil War poems, and observations made in <geogname>Washington, D.C.</geogname>,
                during the Civil War. Whitman also used the notebooks to record the public's
                reaction to and acceptance of his poetry. The earliest notebook in the collection,
                written between <date normal="1847/1854" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1847 and
                    1854</date>, was among the four recovered and contains drafts of one of
                Whitman's most famous poems, <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Song of
                    Myself.</title> Other notebooks contain notes Whitman made while working as a
                nurse in Civil War hospitals in Washington, <date normal="1862/1864" era="ce"
                    calendar="gregorian">1862-1864</date>. The cardboard butterfly is thought to be
                the same Whitman wired on his finger in a photograph that was published as the
                frontispiece for the <date type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                    >1889</date> birthday edition of <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Leaves
                    of Grass</title>. </p>
            
            <p>Only those items deemed poetry and/or prose manuscripts are described in this catalog.</p>

                        <p>In this manuscript Whitman mentions a plan to write a "piece strongly
                            recognizing the affiliations" of his poems. In a centered column,
                            there are three possible titles for such a piece, and one of them is "By
                            the road-sides," which is resonant with the title Whitman would give to
                            the cluster <title render="doublequote">By the Roadside</title> first in
                            the <date normal="1881/1882" type="publication" era="ce"

                        <p>Early discussions of this notebook dated it in the <date
                                normal="1840/1849" era="ce" calendar="gregorioan">1840s</date>, and the date associated with it in
                            the Library of Congress finding aids is <date normal="1847" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1847</date>. The cover of the notebook features a note calling it the "Earliest and Most Important Notebook of Walt Whitman." Recent scholars, however, have argued that Whitman repurposed this notebook, and that most of the writing was more likely from <date normal="1853/1854" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1853&#8211;1854</date>, just before the publication of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>. For an explanation of the reasons for the confusion, and a discussion of the fascinating history of this notebook into the twentieth century, see Matt Miller, <title render="italic">Collage of Myself: Walt Whitman and the Making of Leaves of Grass</title> (Lincoln: University of Nebraska Press, <date normal="2010" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">2010</date>), 2&#8211;8. See also Andrew C. Higgins, <title render="doublequote">Wage Slavery and the Composition of <emph render="italic">Leaves of Grass</emph>: The <emph render="singlequote">Talbot Wilson</emph> Notebook,</title> <title render="italic">Walt Whitman Quarterly Review</title> 20:2 (Fall 2002), 53&#8211;77. Scholars have noted a relationship between this notebook and much of the prose and poetry that appeared in the <date normal="1855" era="ce" calendar="gregorian" type="publication">1855</date> edition of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>. See, for instance, Edward Grier, <title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</title> (New York: New York University Press, 1984), 1:53&#8211;82. The notebook features an early (if not the earliest) example of Whitman using his characteristic long poetic lines, as well as the "generic or cosmic or transcendental 'I'" that appears in <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title> (Grier, 1:55).

                        <p>This manuscript notebook contains a series of diary entries from <date normal="1862-12" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">December
                            1862</date> to <date normal="1863-12" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">December 1863</date>. In the entries, Whitman keeps track of family
                            correspondence and of how he spent his days. He often mentions visiting
                            wounded and dying soldiers in Washington military hospitals. While the
                            whole notebook adds context to Whitman's writings about the Civil War,
                            there are two entries that can be directly linked to specific passages
                            in Whitman's published work. The entry from Monday, <date normal="1863-05-04" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">May 4th, 1863</date> (surface number twelve) mentions "4th Hooker's battles around Fredericksburg
                            to night the wounded begin to arrive from Hooker's command." This passage contributes to the section <title render="doublequote">The Wounded from
                                Chancellorsville</title> published in <title render="italic"

                                calendar="gregorian">1892</date>). The entry from Wednesday,
                            <date normal="1863-09-16" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">September 16th, 1863</date> (surface number thirty-one), reporting the death of Lorenzo Strong, contributes to <title render="doublequote">Last of the War Cases</title> published

                        <p>A disbound notebook, mostly filled with names and addresses. However, the
                            sixty-first surface contains an idea for a poem about "The Storm / all
                            the various things that happen in a storm." It is possible that this is
                            an early conception of the poem that would eventually be titled <title
                                render="doublequote">Proud Music of the Storm</title> (originally
                            titled <title render="doublequote">Proud Musc of the Sea-Storm</title>).
                            The note mentions being "at sea," as well as "sleeping" and "wak[ing],"
                            all of which are ideas found in <title render="doublequote">Proud
                                Music.</title> The range of dates in the notebook also falls within
                            the likely period of compositon for that poem, with an earliest
                            recorded date of <date normal="1867-01" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                                >January 1867</date> (leaf 18). <title render="doublequote">Proud
                                Music of the Sea-Storm</title> was first published in the <date
                                normal="1869-02" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">February 1869</date>
                            issue of the <title render="italic">Atlantic Monthly</title>, but was

                        <p>A notebook from Whitman's trip to Boston in March through May of <date
                                normal="1860" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1860</date>. While most
                            of the notebook is devoted to names, addresses, and notes from his
                            visit, the first two leaves (surfaces 3 and 4) contain notes related to
                            the printing of the <date normal="1860" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                                >1860</date> edition of <title render="italic">Leaves of
                                Grass</title>, which he was in Boston to oversee. The printing notes
                            refer to possible ornamentations for specific pages of <title
                                render="italic">Leaves</title> and reference other books as examples
                            of possible ornamentation and typography. Edward Grier provides
                            information about the specific books that Whitman mentions, noting
                            similarities between them and <title render="italic">Leaves</title>

                        <p>An early notebook, mostly containing the outline(s) of one or more pieces
                            of early fiction. The name of one character, "Mr. Covert," appears in
                            Whitman's story <title render="doublequote">Revenge and Requital; A Tale
                                of a Murderer Escaped,</title> first published in the <title
                                render="italic">United States Magazine and Democratic
                                Review</title> in <date normal="1845-07/1845-08" type="publication" era="ce"
                                calendar="gregorian">July&#8211;August 1845</date>. The piece would be
                            revised and/or reprinted several times in various publications before
                            ultimately appearing as <title render="doublequote">One Wicked
                                Impulse!</title> in <title render="italic">Specimen Days</title>
                            (<date normal="1882/1883" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1882&#8211;83</date>). While the name "Mr. Covert" connects the notebook with <title
                                render="doublequote">One Wicked Impulse!</title> there are only
                            minor similarities between the plot-points of the two. It is thus
                            possible that this notebook contains notes towards a different,
                            as-yet-undiscovered piece of early fiction. Whitman has also pasted two <title render="italic">Tribune</title> clippings (surface 5) and copied two excerpts of poetry
                            (surface 19). The first poetic quotation comes from Robert Blair's poem
                                <title render="doublequote">The Grave</title> (<date normal="1743" type="publication"
                                era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1743</date>). The source of the second
                            quotation is unknown. The cover of the notebook is labeled "Note Book Walt Whitman 82" in a hand that is not Whitman's. A complete transcription of <extref linktype="simple" actuate="onrequest" show="new" href="http://www.whitmanarchive.org/manuscripts/notebooks/transcriptions/loc.04588.html"><title render="doublequote">a schoolmaster</title></extref> is available on <title render="italic">The Walt Whitman Archive</title>.</p>

                                calendar="gregorian">1891</date>). "Nat Bloom," the name that
                            appears on the recto of the third leaf, was a New York City acquaintance
                            of Whitman from as late as the 1870s, according to Edward Grier (<title

                        <p>A manuscript that contains various poetic lines. The line on the second
                            leaf that describes "the Steamship . . . and the trailing pennant of smoke"
                            was incorporated, in a slightly altered form, into the <date

                                >Song of Myself.</title> The line was retained in all subsequent
                            versions of the poem. The connection of the rest of the lines to
                            Whitman's published work is unknown. The versos of both leaves are
                            currently unavailable.</p>

                        <p>A copy in Whitman's hand of a review from an 1844 <title render="italic"
                                linktype="simple">North British Review</title> regarding Michaud's

                                Crusades</title> including several notes by Whitman suggesting a
                            link to "our own war." The second leaf contains a continuation of ideas
                            that Whitman notes in the margin might "open the foregoing" about the
                            sounds of squadrons starting upon their great campaign. While other
                            manuscripts and published works share similarities in topic and idea, a
                            direct link is unknown. The versos of both leaves are blank. Other dated
                            materials containing notes on the crusades suggest this manuscript was
                            likely composed around 1869.</p>

                        <p>One of a number of manuscripts in which Whitman makes notes linking the
                            crusades to a great idea. While other manuscripts and published works
                            share similarities in topic and idea, a direct link is unknown. The
                            verso contains cancelled writing about the steamer <title
                                render="italic" linktype="simple">Georgia</title>. The information
                            is likely from letters between Charles Francis Adams, Minister to
                            England during the Civil War, Earl Russell, British Foreign Minister,
                            and W.H. Seward, Secretary of State concerning the ship and that appear
                            on other crusade related manuscripts. The verso notes seem to have some
                            connection to Whitman's recto writing, as he remarks about "maritime
                            spirit" and "Italian and Spanish navigators." Other dated materials
                            containing notes on the crusades suggest this manuscript was likely
                            composed around 1869.</p>

                        <p>The recto of this manuscript is a prose jotting with no known relationship to Whitman's published work. On the verso is a draft poem which is
                            partially illegible. The language used here reminds of many poems by
                            Whitman, but, especially because the manuscript is partially illegible. The language used here is similar to many poems by Whitman without being clearly linked to any particular poem.</p>

                            A.L." ("In Memory of Abraham Lincoln") are focused on the sense of
                            collective grieving for the death of Lincoln, a founding theme for the
                            poem <title render="doublequote">When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard

                            Funeral piece A.L."), is composed of a short note which can be read as a

                                in the Dooryard Bloom'd,</title> followed by some lines of poetry

                        <p>In this manuscript, entitled "For Note," Whitman seems to be drafting an
                            introductory note for <title render="italic">Memoranda During the
                                War</title>, published in <date normal="1875/1876"
                                type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1875-1876</date>.
                            Although the note does not appear verbatim in <title render="italic"
                                >Memoranda</title>, some passages of this manuscript bear
                            resemblance to the introductory paragraphs in which Whitman reflects on
                            the impossibility of writing a complete and accurate history of the war and offers the rationale for
                            his decision to record a "few glimpses" of "the Hospital part of the drama from
                            '61 to '65."</p>

                            clearly indicates that he thought of using the note for the

                        <p>This prose scrap alludes to both Rabelais and Robert Burns. Here, Whitman
                            describes Burns' principle qualities as "animal appetites, lusts, and
                            bibulousness." In his essay, <title render="doublequote">Robert Burns as
                                Poet and Person,</title> Whitman notes that Burns' poetry includes
                            "lyrics of illicit loves and carousing intoxication." This essay, with
                            the preliminary title of <title render="doublequote">Robert
                                Burns</title> first appeared in <title render="italic">The

                        <p>This prose scrap quotes a <date normal="1792-03" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">March 1792</date> letter from Robert Burns to George Thompson. In the essay <title render="doublequote">Robert Burns as Poet
                                and Person,</title> Whitman cites letters to Thompson, particularly letters
                            where Burns discusses his own early love poetry. This scrap is not
                            directly quoted in the essay, but there are allusions to it. The letters
                            are not mentioned in the preliminary publication of the essay, under the
                            title <title render="doublequote">Robert Burns</title>, which appeared

                            Apparently, Whitman intended to write a longer essay which did not
                            allude to Hicks. Grier dates this scrap from the 1870s because of the
                            steadiness of the handwriting (<title render="italic">Notebooks and Unpublished Prose Manuscripts</title> [New York: New York University Press], 6, 2101).</p>

                        <p> A series of short phrases, the longest of which is written with hanging
                            indentation. This manuscript probably contributed to the couplet "As
                            idly drifting down the ebb, / Such ripples, half-caught voices, echo
                            from the shore," which appears before the final paragraph of <title
                                render="doublequote">A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd Roads,</title>
                            first published in <title render="italic">November Boughs</title> (<date

                                >1888</date>). Most of <title render="doublequote">A Backward Glance
                                O'er Travel'd Roads</title> was drawn from three previously
                            published pieces (<title render="doublequote">A Backward Glance on My

                            part of any of those earlier essays. On the reverse side of the
                            manuscript is a letter to Whitman dated <date normal="1884-11-14"

                        <p>A late notebook with notes for poem ideas, trial titles, addresses, quotations, and other material, some of which is not in Whitman's hand (see surfaces 13, 29, 36 and 38). A few of the entries contributed to published pieces of poetry. Surfaces 21 and 24 include trial titles for <title render="doublequote">Fancies at Navesink,</title> first published in <title render="italic">The Nineteenth Century</title> (<date normal="1885-08" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">August 1885</date>), and reprinted in the <title render="doublequote">Sands at Seventy</title> annex to <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title> (<date normal="1888" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1888</date>). Surface 32 includes a note to "write a poem . . . to be call'd Yonnondio." Whitman first published a poem under this title in the <title render="italic">Critic</title> (<date normal="1887-11-26" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">26 November 1887</date>). The poem was reprinted in <title render="doublequote">Sands at Seventy,</title> an annex to the <date normal="1888" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1888</date> edition of <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title>, and was retained in the <date normal="1892" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1892</date> edition. Surface 40 contains, among other notes, a cancelled line reading "yet my soul-dearest leaves&#8212;the hardest and the last," which appeared, nearly verbatim, as the closing line of <title render="doublequote">You Lingering Sparse Leaves of Me,</title> first published along with three other poems in <title render="italic">Lippincott's Magazine</title> (<date normal="1887-11" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">November 1887</date>) under the general title, <title render="doublequote">November Boughs.</title> These four poems were reprinted in the <title render="doublequote">Sands at Seventy</title> annex to <title render="italic">Leaves of Grass</title> (<date normal="1888" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1888</date>).</p> 
                        <!--<p>This multi-page notebook contains notes and ideas that are fully
                            elaborated in <title render="italic">Democratic Vistas</title> (<date
                                type="publication" normal="1871" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                                >1871</date>) and <title render="italic">Specimen Days &#38; Collect</title> (<date type="publication" normal="1882/1883" era="ce"
                                calendar="gregorian">1882-1883</date>). Particularly of note is a
                            penciled passage that reads "the 'old-gray' is a regular voter," which
                            is developed in the directive in <title render="italic">Democratic
                                Vistas</title> to "always vote" (44). Page 271 of <title
                                render="italic">Specimen Days &#38; Collect</title> describes facts as
                            being "shower'd over with light," a reiteration of the scrap that reads
                            "Facts are divine things." Finally, Presidents Lincoln, Grant, and
                            Garfield are mentioned on one scrap, as well as in the essay <title
                                render="doublequote">Rulers Strictly Out of the Masses</title> in
                                <title render="italic">Specimen Days &#38; Collect</title>.</p>-->

                            soldiers met by Whitman in his visits to the hospital. The name of
                            soldier Reuben Farwell appears twice (in surface number six and surface
                            number ten) and that of soldier Bethuel Smith appears once (in surface
                            number ten). Whitman mentions these two soldiers in the <title

                        <p>The thirty-first leaf in this manuscript notebook contains a note "for
                            Preface" about "gossiping in the candle light" that resonates with the
                            beginning of the second paragraph of the article <title
                                render="doublequote">My Book and I,</title> published in the <title
                                render="italic">Lippincott's Monthly Magazine</title> in <date
                                normal="1887-01" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                                >January 1887</date>. This same passage also appeared one year later
                            in <title render="doublequote">A Backward Glance O'er Travel'd
                                Roads,</title> published within <title render="italic">November
                                Boughs</title> (<date normal="1888" type="publication" era="ce"
                                calendar="gregorian">1888</date>) and later included in <title render="italic">Leaves of

                            that Whitman was possibly considered when preparing <title
                                render="italic">Specimen Days &amp; Collect</title> (<date normal="1882/1883" type="publication" era="ce"
                                calendar="gregorian">1882-1883</date>). The thirty-fifth leaf
                            contains a draft for a poem, including the deleted line "Away from houses,
                            reading, art" that resembles the second line in the poem <title
                                render="doublequote">A Clear Midnight,</title> published in <title render="italic">Leaves of

                        <p>One of a number of manuscripts in which Whitman records and develops
                            ideas for a poem that never emerged about the crusades. In this
                            particular manuscript, Whitman lists figures such as "Peter the Hermit"
                            and "The Popes." While Whitman mentions the crusades specifically
                            in both his prose works <title render="italic" linktype="simple"
                                >Specimen Days &#38; Collect</title> (<date normal="1882/1883" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1882&#8211;1883</date>) and <title render="italic"

                            these manuscript notes and any of his published works is unclear. The
                            verso contains part of a cancelled letter between Charles Francis Adams,
                            Minister to England during the Civil War, and Earl Russell, British
                            Foreign Minister, regarding the Confederate steamer <title
                                render="italic" linktype="simple">Georgia</title> which Whitman
                            would have had to copy from another published document. Other dated
                            materials containing notes on the crusades suggest this manuscript was
                            likely composed around <date normal="1869" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1869</date>.</p>

                            that never emerged about the crusades. In this manuscript, Whitman
                            relates "the Crusades" and "our own great war" through the observation
                            that great revolutions have "been mainly for an idea." Whitman mentions the crusades specifically in both his prose works <title

                            notes and any of his published works is unclear. The verso contains part

                            crusades to America. While other manuscripts and published works share

                            contains a cancelled list of references to letters in the <title

                            publish a version of the lecture as <title render="doublequote">Death of

                        <p>Handwritten notes about Abraham Lincoln, most likely intended for use in
                            Whitman's lecture, <title render="doublequote">Death of Abraham
                                Lincoln.</title> The page numbers refer to Samuel Penniman Bates'
                            book, <title render="italic">The Battle of Gettysburg</title> (Philadelphia: T.H. Davis &amp; Co., <date normal="1875" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1875</date>). Bates had quoted a letter from Lincoln to General Joseph
                            Hooker, making note of Lincoln's characteristic "homely but pointed
                            similes" (13&#8211;14). Whitman also notes pages reproducing the Gettysburgh
                            Address, as well as Edward Everett's remark to Lincoln about the power of his twenty lines (213&#8211;15). Whitman delivered his lecture about Lincoln
                            in New York in <date normal="1879" era="ce" calendar="gregorian"
                                >1879</date> and would deliver it at least eight other times over
                            the succeeding years. Whitman would later publish a version of the
                            lecture as <title render="doublequote">Death of Abraham Lincoln</title>
                            in <title render="italic">Specimen Days</title> (<date

                    <scopecontent>
                        <p>A Civil-War-era notebook containing entries written in <date
                                normal="1862" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1862</date> and <date
                                normal="1863" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1863</date> in both New
                            York and Washington, D.C. Many of the early leaves contain names,
                            addresses, and descriptions of acquaintances in New York. Beginning
                            roughly halfway through the notebook, the entries focus on Whitman's
                            experiences in and around Washington, visiting hospital camps and
                            battle-fields. Several of the entries contributed to published pieces of
                            poetry or prose. Surface 40 mentions the "Apollo Summer Garden," which
                            Whitman wrote about in a <title render="italic">New York Leader</title>
                            column of <date normal="1862-04-19" type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">19

                            "Lindenmuller's Halle" (spelling varies), a beer cellar in the Bowery
                            that was mentioned in the seventh installment of the <title
