<p>
The papers of Walt Whitman in the Charles E. Feinburg Collection span the years 1763 to 1985, with the bulk of the items concentrated in the period after 1841. 

[from original note] Whitman's method of composition can be seen through a wide variety of material in the collection, including handwritten manuscript drafts, edited proofs and offprints, notebooks, diaries, <MED>and commonplace books.<MED>Materials in the collection illustrate Whitman's development as a writer and provide a strong foundation for scholarship in multiple areas of investigation.</p>

The collection of correspondence, literary manuscripts, books, proofs, and associated items assembled by Feinberg during a period of six decades contains letters, notes, postcards, telegrams, memoranda written by Whitman and letters written to him by friends and admirers, as well as a variety of manuscripts and proofs, many of them annotated by Whitman, that reflect the development of literary techniques in his prose and poetry. Whitman's private concerns and interests, some of which would later be voiced in his writings, are revealed in diaries, notes, and notebooks.</p>
<p>
The collection contains series devoted to Whitman manuscripts, a Supplementary File of items relating to Whitman, memorabilia, Addenda, and Oversize. Series containing original Whitman items include Diaries, Dairy Notes, and Address Books, Family Papers, General Correspondence, Literary File, Notes and Notebooks, and Miscellany. The Supplementary File contains personal papers of individuals associated with Whitman and articles, books, and speeches written about him. 

[The following information should be included when entire finding aid is completed at item level] Entries from the catalog published by the Detroit Public Library in 1955 for an exhibition of items from Feinberg's collection are identified with the designation DCN(Detroit catalog number) and are listed numerically in an index at the end of the finding aid. Whitman at times used the reverse side of incoming letters to draft his own correspondence or to note an idea for a trial line for a poem or essay. Verso manuscripts are identified throughout the register by the use of cross references.Since the manuscripts in the collection had been catalogued previously by Feinberg, the titles of these catalog entries were used to determine the placement of an original item within the collection's current arrangment.</p>
<p>
The collection contains the only surviving page from the original manuscript of the first edition of 
<emph render="italic">Leaves of Grass</emph>. The collection also contains Ralph Waldo Emerson's letter of July 21, 1855, in which, after having read the new poet's slim volume, he wrote with warm approval and congratulated Whitman on his achievement, greeting him, "at the beginning of a great career." It was this letter that Whitman used as an endorsement upon the publication of the 1856 edition of <emph render="italic">Leaves of Grass</emph>. Feinberg collected the first edition of all subsequent publications of <emph render="italic">Leaves of Grass</emph> and all of Whitman's other published works, as well as a number of items from Whitman's personal library that had been inscribed or annotated by the poet. All of these volumes are housed in the Rare Book and Special Collections Divisions of the Library of Congress where they are identified as part of the Feinberg Collection.</p>
<p>
Trial lines or full drafts and proofs for a number of Whitman's poems are included, among them <title render="doublequote">Song of Myself,</title><title render="doublequote">Crossing Brooklyn Ferry,</title><title render="doublequote">Out of the Cradle Endlessly Rocking,</title><title render="doublequote">Prayer of Columbus,</title> and <title render="doublequote">Song of the Redwood-Tree.</title> Two commonplace books for the period 1876-1891 records Whitman's literary and social activities, including notations concerning his health and finances as well as the names and addresses of friends and acquaintances. <title render="doublequote">Hospital notebooks</title> describe conditions at Armory Square Hospital, Washington, D.C., and list the names and addresses of soldiersto whom Whitman ministered during the Civil War. A notebook from 1865 contains Whitman's descriptions and observations of the capital city and of the proceedings of Congress in session. Whitman's letters to his mother provide further references to life in Washington. During this period, Whitman establisedh close friendships with John Burroughs, the naturalist, and William Douglas O'Connor and his wife, Ellen, who provided a surrogate home for Whitman. He also formed an intimate relationship with Peter Doyle, a streetcar conductor. Correspondence with these and other friends and associates can be found in the General Correspondence file.</p>
<p>
Whitman's reflections on the events of these years, in particular his reaction to the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, are recorded in <emph render="italic">Drum Taps</emph>, published in 1865, which contains some of his best-known and most critically acclaimed poems, including <title render="doublequote">Oh Captain! My Captain!,</title> <title render="doublequote">When Lilacs Last in the Dooryard Bloom'd,</title> and <title render="doublequote">Beat! Beat! Drums!</title> Notes, trial lines, and drafts of these poems are included in the collection. A <title render="doublequote">reading book</title> that Whitman used for his lectures on the significance of Lincoln's life and death is also located in the Literary File series.</p>
<p>
In 1873, Whitman moved to Camden, New Jersey, and lived there until his death in 1892. The collection contains many writing published during this period, including the poetry and prose in <emph render="italic">November Boughs</emph> (1888) and <emph render="italic">Specimen Days</emph> (1882-1883), Whitman's assemblage of autobiographical reminiscences. The collection includes complete drafts of both these works as well as <emph render="italic">Democratic Vistas</emph> (1871).</p>
<p>
Prominent among Whitman's correspondents is Richard Maurice Bucke, a Canadian physician and mystic who was one of Whitman's most ardent disciples as well as one of his literary executors. Bucke's correspondence is the single largest group in the collection. Among the many foreign admirers, critics, and writers whose letters are contained in the collection are Edward Carpenter (1844-1929), Edward Dowden, Anne Burrows Gilchrist, John Johnston, William Michael Rossetti, Abraham Stoker, John Addington Symonds (1840-1893), Baron Alfred Tennyson, J. W. (James William) Wallace, and Oscar Wilde. Other correspondents include Francis Pharcellus Church, William Conant Church, Moncure Daniel Conway, Mary Whitall Smith Costelloe, Thomas Donaldson (1843-1898), Charles W. Eldridge, Hamlin Garland, Joseph Benson Gilder, Richard Watson Gilder, Ulysses S. (Ulysses Simpson) Grant, Bret Harte, Robert Green Ingersoll, John H. Johnston, William Sloane Kennedy, Sidney H. Morse, T. W. (Thomas William) Rolleston, Bethuel Smith and his parents, Logan Pearsall Smith, Robert Pearsall Smith, members of the Stafford family, J. M. (Joseph Marshall) Stoddart, Horace Traubel, and Talcott Williams.</p>
<p>
The Memorabilia series includes a walking stick carved from a calamus root and given to Whitman by John Burroughs and a haversack which Whitman used on his visits to military hospitals during the Civil War. Other artifacts include such personal possessions as Whitman's pen, pocket watch, and spectacles. </p>
<p>
A substantial amount of material relating to Whitman is arranged in the Supplementary File series. <edited paragraph>Although it includes several original Whitman items, the second addition is composed largely of material relating to Whitman. The addition complements the original collection and reflects its organization, with the bulk of the items arranged in the Supplementary File. In addition to prose notes and trial lines written by Whitman, the second addition includes correspondence and personal papers of Whitman's friends and colleagues as well as associated scholars and collectors, including Albert Aylward, Frank and Mildred Bain, Léon Bazalgette, Charles N. Elliot, Charles E. Feinberg, Thomas Biggs Harned, Henry Scholey Saunders, and Horace and Anne Montgomerie Traubel. Literary manuscripts and production material of speeches and writings about Whitman and related subjects are also contained in this addition.</p>

                        <p>Bound manuscript of <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">After
                                all, not to create only.</title> Although the manuscript contains
                            many revisions, it appears to be relatively near the final draft.
                            Whitman wrote this poem following a request by the Committee on
                            Invitations of the American Institute to deliver an original poem at the
                            opening of the Fortieth Annual Exhibition. <title render="doublequote"
                                linktype="simple">After All, Not to Create Only</title> was first
                            published in <date type="publication" normal="1871" era="ce"
                                calendar="gregorian">1871</date>. It was later revised and the title
                            changed to <title render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Song of the
                                Exposition.</title></p>

                                >Drum-Taps</title>. It was only in 1871 that Whitman added the
                            imagery of ashes to this poem. The manuscript was likely composed around
                            1870-1871, when Whitman was revising and expanding the poem for
                            republication. Alternatively, the manuscript may be a draft of a unique
                            poetic work unpublished in Whitman's lifetime.</p>

                            This manuscript was likely composed around 1870-1871, when
                            Whitman was revising and expanding the poem for republication. This
                            manuscript appears to be a draft of the first two linegroups of <title
                                render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Ashes of Soldiers.</title>
                            These linegroups were added in 1871 to a poem first published as <title
                                render="doublequote" linktype="simple">Hymn of Dead Soldiers</title>
                            in <title render="italic" linktype="simple">Drum-Taps</title> (<date
                                type="publication" era="ce" calendar="gregorian">1865</date>). It
                            was only in 1871 that he added the imagery of ashes to this poem.</p>

                            with two others at the Library of Congress. The proofs have no editorial
                            corrections, but one (pictured here) is signed by Whitman and another
                            contains a note in another hand reading, "from the papers of Walt

                            visit to Brooklyn in the 1790s&#8212;and Whitman's published work. The verso of this manuscript contains cancelled notes on the
                            establishment of the Hudson Avenue Hospital in the <date

                        <p>In these prose notes, Whitman reflects on the impact of the Civil War on
                            the nation. Written at the top of the page, in an unknown hand, possibly that of Horace Traubel, "see
                            notes Mar 18 1891." This manuscript contributed to <title

                        <p>Manuscript notes and clippings of printed prose gathered by Whitman in a
                            homemade notebook created from a copy of John Dunbar Hylton's, <title

                            ideas on the death of Abraham Lincoln. Whitman himself scrawled "Death

                            textual link can be made between this manuscript and <title

                            cancelled, contains a partial draft of an article written in response to
                            an unidentified author who had apparently found fault with American
                            politics and newspaper literature. It is unknown whether the writing on
                            this side led to publication. No images of this item are currently

                                >Leaves of Grass.</title> On one side of the leaf are approximately
                            four lines, written and revised in ink, about the <date normal="1833"
                                calendar="gregorian" era="ce">1833</date> Leonid meteor shower.
                            These lines may be related to the poem <title render="doublequote">Year
                                of Meteors. (1859&#8211;1860),</title> first published in <title
                                render="italic">Drum-Taps</title> (<date normal="1865"
                                calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="publication">1865</date>).
                            Richard Maurice Bucke's transcription of these lines in <title
                                render="italic">Notes and Fragments</title> (<date normal="1899"
                                calendar="gregorian" era="ce" type="publication">1899</date>) begins
                            with another version of these lines and an additional line following
                            them. It is possible that these lines were present on the manuscript
                            when he made his transcription but have since been cut off, though it is
                            also possible that Bucke combined transcriptions from separate leaves.
                            The now-absent final line of Bucke's transcription reads, "Such have I
                            in the round house hanging&#8212;such pictures name I&#8212;and they are
                            but little." If indeed Whitman wrote this line as part of the present
                            manuscript, it would connect it with the early poem <title
                                render="doublequote">Pictures,</title> unpublished during Whitman's
                            lifetime. On the reverse are the trial title <title render="doublequote"
                                >Poem of the Trainer,</title> which is written in ink, and several
                            fragmentary lines written in pencil, describing a whale hunt. The first
                            of these is not known to have any relationship to Whitman's published
                            works. The pencilled lines are probably related to lines on the same
                            topic in <title render="doublequote">A Song of Joys,</title> first
                            published as <title render="doublequote">Poem of Joys</title> in the

                            Pestalozzi. Whitman planned to write an essay about Elias Hicks for many
                            years. While finishing preparations for the printing of <title
                                render="italic">November Boughs,</title> Whitman told Horace
                            Traubel, "Some of these bits were written as many as thirty years ago.
                            Some of them I have written within the past year. They are a
                            miscellaneous lot but they all belong in the same stream." (See Traubel,
                                <title render="italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden,</title> 2: 42.) The present manuscript is stored together with many other
                            manuscripts on the topics of Elias Hicks and Quakerism. Those that
                            directly contributed to the published essay are described separately.
                            Those whose relationship to the published essay are unclear are not
                            included at this stage of our work.</p>

                        <p>Whitman's copy of John G. C. Brainard's <title render="italic">Occasional
                                Pieces of Poetry</title> (<date normal="1825" calendar="gregorian"
                                era="ce">1825</date>), many pages of which bear the poet's
                            handwriting. Whitman appears to have used the volume as a notebook of
                            sorts, for while some of the writing seems to be related to Brainard's
                            text most of it does not. Among the handwritten notes are several sets
                            of ideas for poems that were never published and phrases that also
                            appear in Whitman's personal correspondence. Some of these are phrases
                            that Whitman inscribed in the copy of <title render="italic">Complete
                                Poems &amp; Prose</title> (<date calendar="gregorian" era="ce"
                                type="publication" normal="1888">1888</date>) that he gave to Horace
                            Traubel. On other pages are words from his letter to Anne Gilchrist of
                                <date normal="1871-11-11" calendar="gregorian" era="ce">November 11,
                                1871</date>. These were perhaps copied into the Brainard volume as
                            he worked to write a poem in Gilchrist's honor, though they did not make
                            it into <title render="doublequote">Going Somewhere,</title> the poetic
                            tribute that Whitman published in the <date normal="1887-11"

                        <p>This manuscript about the life of George Fox, written in ink with some
                            corrections in pencil, appears to be a draft introduction for the
                            section headed <title render="doublequote">George Fox (and
                                Shakspere)</title> in the essay <title render="doublequote">Notes
                                (such as they are) founded on Elias Hicks.</title> This essay was
                            first published in <title render="italic">November Boughs</title> (<date
                                type="publication" calendar="gregorian" era="ce" normal="1888"
                                >1888</date>) and later reprinted in <title render="italic">Complete
                                Prose Works</title> (<date normal="1892" calendar="gregorian"
                                era="ce" type="publication">1892</date>). Whitman abandoned the
                            approach to his topic that is suggested in the first paragraph of the
                            manuscript, but the paragraph indicated by the pointing hand, at the
                            bottom of the manuscript, contains the kernel of a key paragraph in the
                            published version. Whitman planned to write an essay about Elias Hicks
                            for many years. While finishing preparations for the printing of <title
                                render="italic">November Boughs,</title> Whitman told Horace
                            Traubel, "Some of these bits were written as many as thirty years ago.
                            Some of them I have written within the past year. They are a
                            miscellaneous lot but they all belong in the same stream." (See Traubel,
                                <title render="italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden,</title> 2: 42.) The present manuscript is stored together with many other
                            manuscripts on the topics of Elias Hicks and Quakerism. Those that

                        <p>This one-page prose draft regarding the birthplace of Elias Hicks was
                            likely one of the manuscripts from which Whitman fashioned his <date

                                are) founded on Elias Hicks,</title> first published in <title

                                >1892</date>). The reference to Elias Hicks's daughter Martha Hicks
                            Aldrich as "still living" suggests that Whitman began writing this
                            manuscript before 1862, the year of Martha's death. The reference, in
                            the revision of this passage, to her death "a year or two ago," "about
                            1863," would seem to indicate that at least that portion of the
                            manuscript was written around 1865. Whitman planned to write an essay
                            about Elias Hicks for many years. While finishing preparations for the
                            printing of <title render="italic">November Boughs,</title> Whitman told
                            Horace Traubel, "Some of these bits were written as many as thirty years
                            ago. Some of them I have written within the past year. They are a
                            miscellaneous lot but they all belong in the same stream." (See Traubel,
                                <title render="italic">With Walt Whitman in Camden,</title> 2: 42.) The present manuscript is stored together with many other
                            manuscripts on the topics of Elias Hicks and Quakerism. Those that
                            directly contributed to the published essay are described separately.
                            Those whose relationship to the published essay are unclear are not
                            included at this stage of our work.</p>
