                    <p>The General Act of the <orgName key="con.ber">Berlin Conference</orgName> was signed on February 26, 1885 at the close of the Berlin Conference of 1884-5. The signatories of the act represented the United States, Germany, Belgium, Spain, Denmark, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, Russia, Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and United Kingdoms of Norway and Sweden. The General Act, once ratified, bound the signatory nations to combating the continental slave trade in Africa, recognizing the sovereignty of the Congo Free State, respecting the protectorates and territorial possessions already present in Africa, and insuring the free navigation of the Congo and Niger Rivers and their tributaries. On the latter point, the Act dictated that railroads, roads, and "lateral canals" connected to the rivers be zones of free commerce and navigation. It made provisions to establish the International Commission of Navigation of the Congo to oversee this. <ref target="#Art20">(See Article 20)</ref></p>
                    
                    <p>Additionally, by declaring the free navigation of the Niger, the Act ended the British and French dispute over which nation held sovereignty over the river. The Act also outlined the boundaries of the Congo Basin and committed all signatories to insuring "commercial liberty" in the basin, its embouchures, and its "neighbouring country, and dispositions connected therewith." Accordingly, the Act forbade commercial monopolies in the Congo and prevented "powers" in the region from enacting import and export duties on goods brought into the region for twenty years. Mindful that foreign travel to Africa had increased during the nineteenth century, the Act required the signees to protect "natives," travelers, and missionaries, as well as guarantee "liberty of conscience" and "religious toleration" for these persons. The conference attendees charged each signee to urge their respective governments to ratify the document within one year of its signing. The United States was the only power represented at the conference that did not deposit its ratification with the Berlin Foreign Office by April 1886.<note xml:id="n1">See Stig F&#246;rster, Wolfgang J.

                    <p>The General Act, in many ways, recognized what was occurring on in the continent since the early nineteenth century&#8212;the incremental penetration of the continent by Europeans, predominantly. This penetration intensified in the 1860s and 1870s with such events as Britain's punitive expedition against Abyssinia (1867-1868), King <persName key="leopold.ii">Leopold</persName>'s claim to the Congo Free State in 1876, and Henry Morton Stanley's Anglo-American Expedition of 1878, to name a few. The dispute between France and Great Britain over Egypt in the 1880s brought the question of control over Africa to a head. In the immediate years following the signing of the Act and its ratification, European powers solidified their control over West Africa, establishing protectorates with access to the Atlantic coast. While the Act pledged to protect the natives and gave special protection to "[C]hristian missionaries, the savants [scientists], the explorers, their escorts, properties and collections," it became increasingly clear that the European powers aimed to dispossess Africans of their most fertile lands, to mobilize African labor (oftentimes violently) in service of the empire, to force Christianity on Africans, and to decrease the influence of Islam on the continent. In the last decade of the nineteenth century, European imperialist met resistance from African kingdoms, caliphates, states, and acephalous societies. However, by the turn of the twentieth century, most of Africa was under European control with the exception of Liberia and Abyssinia.<note xml:id="n2">John Iliffe, <hi rend="italics">Africans: The History of a Continent</hi> (London: Cambridge University Press, 1995), 187-190.</note></p>

                    <p>1st. In all the territories constituting the basin of the Congo and its affluents. This basin is defined by the crests of the contiguous basins, to wit: notably the basins of the Niari, of the Ogove, of the Schari and of the Nile, on the North; by the line of Eastern water shed of the affluents of lake Tanganyka on the East; by the crests of the basins of the Zambeze and of the Loge, on the South. It embraces, consequently, all the territories drained by the Congo and its affluents, including the lake Tanganyka and its Eastern tributaries.</p>

                        avoiding the basin of the Ogove to which the stipulations of the present
                    Act do not apply.</p>
                    
                    <p>The Southern boundary shall follow the course of the Loge up to the source of this river and shall be directed thence Eastward to the junction of the geographical basin of the Congo.</p>
                    
                    <p>3rd. In the zone prolonged to the East of the Congo basin as it is above described, as far as the Indian ocean, from the fifth degree of North latitude to the mouth of the Zambeze on the South; from this point the line of demarcation shall follow the Zambeze to a point five miles above the confluence of the Shire and shall continue by the line of water shed separating the waters which flow towards the lake Nyassa from the waters tributary to the Zambeze to rejoin finally the line dividing the waters of the Zambeze and of the Congo.</p>
                    
                    <p>It is expressly understood that in extending to this Eastern zone the
                    principle of commercial liberty the Powers represented at the Conference only engage for themselves and that this principle shall apply to territories actually belonging to any independent and sovereign State only
                    in so far as it shall give its consent thereto. The Powers agree to employ their good offices with the governments established upon the African
                        littoral of the Indian ocean in order to obtain such consent and, in
                    every case, to assure to the transit of all nations the most favorable conditions.</p>

                    <p>The navigation of the Congo, without exception of any of the branches
                    or issues of this river, is and shall remain entirely free for merchant
                    vessels, loaded or in ballast, of all nations, as well for the transport of
                    merchandise as for that of travelers. It must conform itself to the
                    dispositions of the present navigation Act and to the regulations to be
                    established in the execution of the same Act.</p>
                    
                    <p>In the exercise of this navigation the subjects and the flags of all the
                    nations shall be treated, in all respects, upon the footing of a perfect
                    equality, as well for the direct navigation from the open sea toward the
                    interior ports of the Congo, and vice versa, as for the great and small
                    coastwise navigation and also for the small-boat transportation throughout the extent of this river.</p>
                    
                    <p>Consequently, throughout the extent and at the mouths of the Congo,
                    no distinction shall be made between the subjects of riparian and nonriparian States, and no exclusive privilege of navigation shall be conceded, either to societies or corporations of any kind or to private persons.</p>
                    
                    <p>These dispositions are recognized by the signatory powers as forming
                    henceforth a part of public international law.</p>

                    which shall have the character of compensation for services rendered to
                    navigation itself, namely:</p>

                    instituted by Article 17 may negotiate in its own name loans exclusively
                    based upon the revenues attributed to the said Commission.</p>

                    must be taken by a majority Vote of two-thirds. It is understood that
                    the governments represented in the Commission cannot, in any case, be
                    considered as assuming any guarantee or contracting any engagement
                    or responsibility in respect to said loans, unless by special conventions
                    concluded by them to this effect.</p>
                    
                    <p>The product of the dues specified in the 3rd. paragraph of Article 14
                    shall be by priority assigned to the service of the interest and to the
