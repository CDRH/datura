      <div class="salute">Dear Sir:— </div>
      
      
      	
      <p>I have been making considerable study of your
         collected poems of late, and the more I have read the greater
         has been my desire to write a letter of appreciation to you.
         It has always seemed to me that a word of appreciation even
         from the least to the greatest could hardly be considered
         out of place, especially by a man whose soul is great enough
         to make a poet of him. Also, there is among all true lovers
         of Beauty a tie that binds. And in my way I am one of these.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Although I had read your work in periodicals from time to
         time, I had never quite discovered you until my friend,
         Mr. Ledoux of New York, put me in the way of seeing you in
         your true  bigness. Since then I have placed your poems in
         that portion of my library sacred to Shelley and Keats.
         I place you between these, for I think I have discovered your
         spiritual kinship to both of them, although I feel that you 
         are nearer the former.
      </p>
      	
      <p>In my correspondence with Mr. Ledoux there have been
         for me many interesting developments; but when he spoke 
         of you as a man with whom he was acquainted, I experienced
         a feeling of awe when I touched his letter, and I found myself

         <div class="l">Ah, did you once see Shelley plain, </div>
         	
         <div class="l">And did he stop and speak to you </div>
         	
         <div class="l">And did you speak to him again? </div>
         	
         <div class="l">How strange it seems and new! </div> 
      </div>
      	
      	
      <p>I am one of those who prostrate themselves before genius —
         and that alone. If you no longer do this yourself, I feel
         safe in saying that there was a time when you could do this
         and be utterly sincere.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I beg you to believe that I have not written this letter
         with the vulgar desire of obtaining your autograph. I have
         merely wished to let you know that on the prairies of the
         West there is another who admires you.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I judge from Mr. Ledoux's correspondence that this will
         find you in Sicily. I hope that it will find you with that
         unfailing belief in self which is the strength of the artist.
         The world needs great poets now and always; and you have a
         great mission. I know that your poetical work is not yet
         read by the many — perhaps it never shall be. And to me
         this is not the smallest portion of the praise which you
         receive. I think Shelley could have spoken a wise word
         on this subject. The world at large does not ask for its
         great artists. They come of their own accord and establish
         themselves in the hearts of men only under protest. They are
         the guests who ultimately can not be denied.

      <p>It does my soul good to feel that we have a poet of
         large dimensions among us. To a lover of Beauty there is
         much of discouragement in the present day commercialism.
         The majority of our countrymen are hopelessly sordid in their
         ambitions. They know nothing of that Upper Air which all 
         of us may  breathe if we wish.
      </p>
      	
      <p>O the poor foolish ones who think that wealth means
         money! Long after these silly heaps of stocks and bonds
         have ceased to exist except in fables with bitter morals,
         you and the few others among us who sing of the higher life,
         will be living, breathing realities.
      </p>
      	
      <p>You know all this; but I wanted you to know that a new
         friend, living far away from you, has applied these truths
         to your life and work.
      </p>
      	
      <p>If you had written nothing but "He ate the Laurel and is Mad"
         and that exquisite first lyric in "Siena", you should have
         been deeply impressed upon my heart. But when you wrote "My
         Country", all good Americans became your debtors, although
         they may not be conscious of the fact.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I want to see you the Shelley of the western world.</p>
