      <h3>BIOGRAPHICAL SKETCHES</h3>
      
      <h4>John G. Neihardt correspondents</h4>
      
      <p>Neihardt’s professional literary correspondence includes exchange with figures of
         national and international importance and as such provides direct evidence of his
         wide-ranging and inclusive intellectual relationships.   In the first few decades
         after Frederick Jackson Turner declared the American frontier “closed,” Neihardt’s
         list of correspondents represents another kind of open space ready to be explored
         — an extensive network of adventurous and diverse minds eager to share knowledge and
         information across many kinds of educational, political and social boundaries and
         differences of religion, race, gender, and geographical region.

      <div class="note">Born in Kentucky, author of 36 books and nearly 3,000 poems; known as the Keats of
         Kentucky for his Romantic evocation of natural world.  Earning an international reputation,
         Edmund Gosse selected the verse and wrote the introduction to his collection, Kentucky
         Poems; his work was recognized by Pres. Theodore Roosevelt with an invitation to the
         White House (1905); his friendships included Kate Chopin, E. A. Robinson, Oliver Wendell
         Holmes.
         
         In 1913, he published a poem entitled “Waste Land” in Poetry magazine in an issue
         that also contained an essay by Ezra Pound.  Said to have influenced T. S. Eliot’s
         1922 work, “The Waste Land,” (which is often identified as the beginning of modernist
         poetry), Cawein’s work also drew deeply upon Anglo-European literary allusion and
         classical mythology.  Unlike Eliot, however, he wrote in traditional verse form.

         and attended graduate school at Butler University and the University of Indiana School
         of Medicine. Emulating Louis Agassiz, he studied ichthyology and taught natural history,
         writing over half a dozen scientific texts on fish and discovering over two thousand
         species, becoming one of the foremost American experts on fish.   He joined the faculty
         of the University of Indiana in natural history in 1879 and was named president in
         1885 (the nation’s youngest at the time).  In 1891, upon the recommendation of Andrew
         White, then President of Cornell, he became first President of the newly established
         Stanford University.
         
         In addition to his work in education and administration, he was a peace activist who
         opposed war (for evolutionary reasons to preserve the genetic diversity) and served
         as president of the World Peace Foundation and World Peace Conference.  He testified
         as an expert witness for the defense in the Scopes Trial and worked with the ACLU

         Foundation, an organization that distributed information about eugenics, especially

         dime novels and stories for pulp magazines to earn money for tuition.  An idealistic
         socialist, the social and political critique of his novels led to real-world action,

         Sinclair had a strong interest in occult phenomena and telepathy. Mental Radio (1930) recounts his wife Mary’s telepathic ability and experiences.  This book was
