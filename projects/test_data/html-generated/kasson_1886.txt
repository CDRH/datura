         <h4>Summary</h4>
         
         
         <p>
            <span class="persName">John A. Kasson</span> held diplomatic posts as U.S. Ambassador to Austria-Hungary from 1877-1881 and to
            the German Empire from 1884–1885. It was during this latter assignment, that he attended
            the Berlin Conference (a.k.a. the 
            <em>Kongokonferenz</em>) of 1884-85 and subsequently persuaded the United States to recognize the sovereignty
            of the Congo Free State and to ratify the  
            <a href="berlin_act_1885.html" id="berlin_act_1885.html.ref" class="footnote">General Act of the Berlin Conference</a> . Kasson proved successful in the first endeavor, but failed to convince President
            Cleveland to present the treaty to the Senate for ratification.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The purpose of Kasson's 1886 article was to convince readers of the necessity for
            the U.S. Senate to ratify the  
            <a href="berlin_act_1885.html" id="berlin_act_1885.html.ref" class="footnote">General Act</a>  by the April 1886 deadline. The article opens with a summary of President Cleveland's
            address in which the president explained his objection to bringing the Act before
            the Senate based on his belief that the U.S. held "no established interests or control"
            in the "remote valley of the Congo." Kasson then lays out a detailed summary of what
            transpired at the conference and the obligations outlined in the Act, emphasizing
            that the Act does not obligate the United States to commit troops to enforcing freedom
            of navigation of the Niger and Congo Rivers and free trade in the Congo Basin—the
            latter a claim made by the State Department. Kasson concludes that in the interest
            of promoting Christianity, civilization, and commerce in the Congo region, the United
            States should either ratify the Act or accept it "as a 'separate act' for which it
            makes provision."

         <h4>Analysis</h4>
         
         
         <p>Kasson was among the few public American voices that encouraged the United States
            to ratify the  
            <a href="berlin_act_1885.html" id="berlin_act_1885.html.ref" class="footnote">General Act of the Berlin Conference</a> . As the article makes clear, the State Department and the President feared that ratifying
            the Act would bound the country to intervening in foreign conflicts in foreign colonial
            possessions where the U.S. held no strategic, commercial, or diplomatic interest.
            Despite the fact that the country was engaged in its own expansion across the continent
            and overseas in the late nineteenth century (i.e., the "new imperialism"), many U.S.
            politicians advocated an isolationist foreign policy, with some exceptions made for
            affairs in the Western Hemisphere.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>In contrast, Kasson was an expansionist who believed that the United States should
            abandon the Monroe Doctrine and pursue territories abroad. Kasson played an active
            role in the conference, persuading the delegates to adopt British explorer Henry Morton
            Stanley's boundaries for delineating the Congo Basin. He also encouraged the European
            powers to respect the rights of Africans and African rulers in deciding if and when
            to cede their land. Kasson's plea for ratification of the Act constituted one important
            current in the American discourse on the Africa Question which focused on the potential
            commercial and economic benefits of the agreement for the United States.

         <span class="inline_quote">This declaration constitutes an agreement on the part of all the governments adhering
            to it that the commerce of each of their nations shall enjoy complete liberty in all
            the region drained by the Congo and its affluents, including therewith Lake Tanganyika
            and its eastern tributaries: also in the Atlantic zone lying on both sides of the
            Congo basin proper between latitude 2° degrees 30´ south, and the river Logé, prolonging
            these lines eastward from the Atlantic until they reach the Congo basin also: in the
            zone lying eastward of the Congo basin and situate between the 5th degree of north
            latitude and the river Zambesi on the south and extending to the Indian Ocean on the
            east. But it was expressly understood that the provisions should only apply to the
            territories of any independent power in this eastward zone (like Zanzibar) after such
            Government should give its assent; and the Conference powers agreed to use their influence
            to obtain this consent. [124-125]

         <span class="inline_quote">The fourth and fifth of the resolutions of the Conference establish an agreement that
            the two greatest commercial rivers of Western Africa, the Niger and Congo, as well
            as all artificial water ways or railroads connecting their waters respectively, shall
            forever remain open to the navigation and commercial use of all nations, on terms
            of perfect equality. No embarrassing or discriminating regulations shall be applied;
            and other national interests shall have the same liberty and rights on these rivers
            as those of the possessory powers. No nation may create a monopoly on either river.
            This navigation is to remain forever free and open to neutral commerce, even in time
            of war. [129-130]

         <p>Kasson lays out the boundaries of the regions covered by the  
            <a href="berlin_act_1885.html" id="berlin_act_1885.html.ref" class="footnote">General Act of the Berlin Conference</a> , underscoring the commitment of the signatories to insuring freedom of commerce in
            the Congo Basin, as well as on the Congo River and all its tributaries to the east
            as far as Lake Tanganyika and the Indian Ocean and westward to the Atlantic Ocean.
            In addition, he explains that the Niger and Congo Rivers, their tributaries, and any
            canals or railroads leading to them, are subject to freedom of navigation in times
            of war and peace.
