         <h4>Summary</h4>
         
         
         <p>The General Act of the Berlin Conference was signed on February 26, 1885 at the close of the Berlin Conference of 1884-5.
            The signatories of the act represented the United States, Germany, Belgium, Spain,
            Denmark, France, Italy, the United Kingdom, Austria-Hungary, the Netherlands, Russia,
            Portugal, the Ottoman Empire, and United Kingdoms of Norway and Sweden. The General
            Act, once ratified, bound the signatory nations to combating the continental slave
            trade in Africa, recognizing the sovereignty of the Congo Free State, respecting the
            protectorates and territorial possessions already present in Africa, and insuring
            the free navigation of the Congo and Niger Rivers and their tributaries. On the latter
            point, the Act dictated that railroads, roads, and "lateral canals" connected to the
            rivers be zones of free commerce and navigation. It made provisions to establish the
            International Commission of Navigation of the Congo to oversee this.  
            <a href="#Art20" id="#Art20.ref" class="footnote">(See Article 20)</a> 
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Additionally, by declaring the free navigation of the Niger, the Act ended the British
            and French dispute over which nation held sovereignty over the river. The Act also
            outlined the boundaries of the Congo Basin and committed all signatories to insuring
            "commercial liberty" in the basin, its embouchures, and its "neighbouring country,
            and dispositions connected therewith." Accordingly, the Act forbade commercial monopolies
            in the Congo and prevented "powers" in the region from enacting import and export
            duties on goods brought into the region for twenty years. Mindful that foreign travel
            to Africa had increased during the nineteenth century, the Act required the signees
            to protect "natives," travelers, and missionaries, as well as guarantee "liberty of
            conscience" and "religious toleration" for these persons. The conference attendees
            charged each signee to urge their respective governments to ratify the document within
            one year of its signing. The United States was the only power represented at the conference
            that did not deposit its ratification with the Berlin Foreign Office by April 1886.

         <h4>Analysis</h4>
         
         
         <p>The General Act, in many ways, recognized what was occurring on in the continent since
            the early nineteenth century—the incremental penetration of the continent by Europeans,
            predominantly. This penetration intensified in the 1860s and 1870s with such events
            as Britain's punitive expedition against Abyssinia (1867-1868), King 
            <span class="persName">Leopold</span>'s claim to the Congo Free State in 1876, and Henry Morton Stanley's Anglo-American
            Expedition of 1878, to name a few. The dispute between France and Great Britain over
            Egypt in the 1880s brought the question of control over Africa to a head. In the immediate
            years following the signing of the Act and its ratification, European powers solidified
            their control over West Africa, establishing protectorates with access to the Atlantic
            coast. While the Act pledged to protect the natives and gave special protection to
            "[C]hristian missionaries, the savants [scientists], the explorers, their escorts,
            properties and collections," it became increasingly clear that the European powers
            aimed to dispossess Africans of their most fertile lands, to mobilize African labor
            (oftentimes violently) in service of the empire, to force Christianity on Africans,
            and to decrease the influence of Islam on the continent. In the last decade of the
            nineteenth century, European imperialist met resistance from African kingdoms, caliphates,
            states, and acephalous societies. However, by the turn of the twentieth century, most
            of Africa was under European control with the exception of Liberia and Abyssinia.

      <p>Wishing to regulate in a spirit of good mutual understanding the conditions most favorable

         African rivers which empty into the Atlantic ocean; desirous on the other hand to

         the Congress of Vienna and designed to regulate between the Powers signatory to said
         Act, the free navigation of navigable water courses which separate or traverse several

            basins of the Niari, of the Ogove, of the Schari and of the Nile, on the North; by
            the line of Eastern water shed of the affluents of lake Tanganyka on the East; by
            the crests of the basins of the Zambeze and of the Loge, on the South. It embraces,
            consequently, all the territories drained by the Congo and its affluents, including
            the lake Tanganyka and its Eastern tributaries.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>2nd. In the maritime zone extending along the Atlantic ocean from
            the parallel of 2° 30’ Southern latitude to the mouth of the Loge.
         </p>

            avoiding the basin of the Ogove to which the stipulations of the present
            Act do not apply.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The Southern boundary shall follow the course of the Loge up to the source of this
            river and shall be directed thence Eastward to the junction of the geographical basin
            of the Congo.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>3rd. In the zone prolonged to the East of the Congo basin as it is above described,
            as far as the Indian ocean, from the fifth degree of North latitude to the mouth of
            the Zambeze on the South; from this point the line of demarcation shall follow the
            Zambeze to a point five miles above the confluence of the Shire and shall continue
            by the line of water shed separating the waters which flow towards the lake Nyassa
            from the waters tributary to the Zambeze to rejoin finally the line dividing the waters
            of the Zambeze and of the Congo.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It is expressly understood that in extending to this Eastern zone the
            principle of commercial liberty the Powers represented at the Conference only engage
            for themselves and that this principle shall apply to territories actually belonging
            to any independent and sovereign State only
            in so far as it shall give its consent thereto. The Powers agree to employ their good
            offices with the governments established upon the African
            littoral of the Indian ocean in order to obtain such consent and, in
            every case, to assure to the transit of all nations the most favorable conditions.

            which may have recourse to the Powers represented in the Commission

         <p>Great Britain engages itself to apply the principles of the liberty of navigation
            announced in Articles 26, 27, 28, 29, in so far as the waters of the Niger, of its
            affluents, branches and issues, are or shall be under
            its sovereignty or protectorate.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The regulations which it shall establish for the safety and control of
            navigation shall be conceived in a manner to facilitate so far as possible
            the circulation of merchant vessels.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>It is understood that nothing in the engagements thus taken can be
            interpreted as preventing or able to prevent Great Britain from making
            such regulations of navigation whatever they may be, as may not be
            contrary to the spirit of these engagements.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Great Britain engages itself to protect the foreign traders of all
            nations carrying on commerce in the portions of the course of the Niger
            which are or shall be under its sovereignty or protectorate, as if they
            were its own subjects, provided always that these traders conform to
            the regulations which are or shall be established in virtue of what
            precedes.

            belligerent, shall be free at all times for the uses of commerce upon the
            Niger, its branches and affluents, its embouchures and issues, as also upon
