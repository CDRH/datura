   <h4>"I'm Going to Marry Peggy"</h4>
   
   <div class="byline">By 
      <span class="persName">LILIAN DUCEY</span> 
   </div>
   
   
   <p>I WANT to marry Robert. (There! It took courage to write that even in this little
      book I never expect any one to peer into.)
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yes, I have an overwhelming desire to marry him, and he wants to marry me, as every
      one as well as myself knows. To be sure, other men have asked me to marry them since
      Tom died, and more than once I have been inclined to agree, which is why I hesitate
      until my head sets its seal of approval upon my heart's desire.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day he grew impatient. "What's thinking got to do with it?" he questioned irritably.
      "Either you love me enough to marry me, or you don't."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"That's just what I can't decide," I retorted,—"whether I love you enough."</p>
   
   
   <p>Again he broke out irritably, "Well, thinking won't help you to a decision. Love doesn't
      think: it feels."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I looked him steadily in the eyes. "Until it does both," I answered, "it ought not
      to marry. That's the test I've set myself. Fifteen years ago the first tingle from
      Life's battery made me imagine myself in love. But I've lived and learned since then.
      I'll never make that same mistake again, because—"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He cut me short: "You new women!" It was a somewhat contemptuous exclamation.</p>
   
   
   <p>And I laughed outright, in spite of the fact that I was keyed tremendously to the
      momentous moment. "There you go!" I said lightly. "You're just like all the men. Every
      time they disapprove of a woman they call her 'new.' Don't you know, you old Adam
      man, that there is nothing new under the sun, not even a woman? Why, every one of
      us is part and parcel of what we have always been. The only thing new about us is
      that we are daring to air a few timid little notions we've harbored since time began.
      But our hearts are the same—always will be." I sighed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Well?" he challenged.</p>
   
   
   <p>"Robert, I want to tell you something." I was playing for time, begging the ultimate
      moment. "You make me think of a little boy who is so eager for an apple held close
      to his eye that he lets it shut out the—"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Let's say a peach," Robert cut in, with a sudden bubbling up of humor. "You may not
      think it of my love, Margaret, but I'd hate to connect you even in the remotest way
      with that forbidden fruit."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I laughed. The clouds scurried away; but I finished what I had begun to say. "A peach,
      if you like—but you let it shut out the horizon. How do you know I'm the right woman
      for you, any more than I know you are the right man for me?"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"I know," he answered, and with such a ring of decision that I felt an odd sensation
      of lukewarmness.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Yet I wasn't lukewarm, except in my attitude. And the next moment he said suddenly,
      "Look sharp now! I'm going to kiss you!" and followed out the threat.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And still I keep considering and considering this impulse within me to say yes, without
      reaching any decision. Marriage is natural. It is fulfilment. Home is the romance
      of desire, the justification of being. And furthermore there is in every woman's heart
      an ethereal human yearning for a mate that is as far above the corporeal amatory instinct
      as heaven is above earth. Yet I allowed Robert to go stamping away, angry at my indecision.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I HAVE a visitor—I ought to say two  visitors,—little Geraldine Jones and her baby.
      Geraldine—Jerry, as we call her—has left her young husband. With the impulsiveness
      of nineteen she packed up and came to me, saying naively:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"One can't walk into every household with a baby; they're not wanted. But you're his
      godmother, and you've no boss; so I guess you've just got to take us and keep us."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Yes, I've been playing mother. But, God! what a bitter-sweet feeling it has given
      me! Only a woman of thirty and more can understand what the realization is of the
      years slipping by, and the great fear that crushes against the heart that soon it
      will be too late.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>ROBERT came in looking rather grim this evening. "I am going to put it straight to
      you, Margaret," he said crisply without preface, like a man taking a plunge. "I want
      to marry. I'm forty, as you know, and it's high time. What's more to the purpose,
      I want a home. And I want it now. I've never in my life asked any other woman but
      you to marry me—don't want to—hope you won't force me to it. But I intend to—unless—"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Going! Going! Gone!" I laughed. "So this is my last chance?"</p>
   
   
   <p>"You said it. Your last chance!" and he scowled away my levity.</p>
   
   
   <p>"How tactfully you express yourself," again I laughed. But I was piqued and—yes, and
      hurt. "You want a home, and the woman doesn't matter particularly—any woman will do."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Any will have to do." His eyes were flinty.</p>
   
   
   <p>If he had picked me up and carried me off I should probably have been glad in my secret
      heart that the decision had been made for me. But as it was I had to defend myself.
      Pride forbade anything else. I spoke, or tried to speak, as stonily as he.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Then the sooner you begin to look for her, the sooner you will be settled in life.
      
      
   </p>
   <p>
      <div class="inline_figure">

         <p>
            <em>"Look sharp now! I'm going to kiss you!"</em>
         </p>
         
         
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      
      It's too bad, Robert, that you bothered so long with me."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He rose angrily. Before I realized he was going, the hall door—
      <em>slammed</em>.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And then I did a queer thing, quite without volition. I rushed to the window and called
      his name softly, then louder. But he never turned.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I CAME back this evening on the same train with Robert, and, as if the fates had arranged
      things, every seat in the car
      
      
      
      was taken except the one beside him. And so with sudden daring I said:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"May I, Robert—even supposing the future Mrs. MacAllister hears of it—sit here?"</p>
   
   
   <p>He looked at me astounded, then seemed to collect himself and laughed. "I'll answer
      for her not minding," he replied. And then, with cheerful, downright good fellowship
      in his tone, he went on: "You're the first to hear of it, Margaret—keep it a secret
      for a few days longer. I'm going to be married in ten days—ten days from to-morrow.
      It's rushing things somewhat, but we're going to rent the Hemingways' apartment (they're
      going abroad) until we can get our own nest furnished. I can't even get off for a
      honeymoon just now; but Peggy doesn't mind."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I was stunned for an instant; but a stab to the heart often affects a woman like an
      invigorating hypodermic.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Peggy?" I knitted my brows smilingly over the name. There were no Peggys among our
      mutual acquaintances.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"You don't know her," he offered. "Dear, sweet little girl. I have her down in the
      office."
   </p>
   
   <p>He wasn't looking at me. The train sped on. I know I laughed too. I had to laugh to
      hide what was going on within me. Life is a mask.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I'm crying!</p>
   
   
   <p>I HAVE been doing nothing since Jerry and the baby left but groveling in the dregs
      of my loneliness. Their going left a void. And I look at the conclusion of my last
      entry and want to do the same, same thing. I find I haven't even the heart to write
      in here.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>WITH just half an hour to write, I must try to be brief. But I must have a little
      self-communing—which is really what this book stands for.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Ever since that day on the train I have been fighting despair. And this day, the day
      on which he told me he was to be married, came a letter from him.
   </p>
   
   
   <div class="floatingText">
      
      
      <p>DEAR MARGARET: I am writing this in the office, with Peggy beside me. Tomorrow, as
         I told you, is the appointed time. But Peggy refuses—flatly refuses. She knows (from
         what source I can not gather) that I have been your suitor for many years, and she
         thinks you are still my lodestar. I have, talked and argued with her. She's adamant!
         But she says this: that if you will tell her with your own lips, here in this office,
         that you will never marry me, she will, notwithstanding the rumor that I am still
         devoted to you.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>And so you see, Margaret, the sum and substance of this letter is to ask you to show
         me that friendship you have so often offered me in place of what I wanted. Come to
         the office tomorrow—the day this reaches you—and do me that last good turn. You will
         find us here until four o'clock, as we have made of will interfere with the routine
         of business.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Margaret, this is a great favor I am asking, but I have great faith in your womanliness.
         Please don't fail me.
      </p>
      
       
   </div>
   
   
   <p>What else could I do but comply with. such a request? But it was just five minutes
      before four when I entered Robert's office—or rather the outside office where the
      men were just getting into their coats, preparatory to leaving for the day. One of
      them, however, ushered me into the private office.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I found Robert pacing the floor with such a set look on his face that it seemed as
      if agony had etched itself on his features. But as he saw me his gaze softened.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"AFTER the men go," he said huskily, "we'll have Peggy in. Margaret, this is fine
      of you! I haven't dared to hope—"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"And why not?"</p>
   
   
   <p>He offered me a chair; but I walked over to the window and stood with my back to it.
      Then I asked:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"What is it you want me to say? I don't want to make any mistakes."</p>
   
   
   <p>He did not answer me,—just seemed to be listening to something else, either for Peggy's
      coming or the exit of the men, I thought. After a moment I asked with a laugh:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"But where on earth have you hidden her? She wasn't outside when I came in. Is she
      perhaps in a drawer of your desk?
      He gave me a look, an indescribable look. Then as the door outside slammed he said
      queerly, "That's it, Margaret. You've guessed it. I keep her in my desk."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>I know I looked amazed. What else I looked I do not know. But beneath that consternation
      lay a numbness that paralyzed my reasoning powers. I added—and I hoped I gave a right,
      light inflection to the words:
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"In your desk?"</p>
   
   
   <p>"Yes," he said.</p>
   
   
   <p>He drew out a drawer of his desk: What he took out of it I did not see until he stood
      beside me. Then wordlessly be placed it before my eyes. 
      <em>It was a picture of me</em>,—a little picture taken when I was about eighteen, and on the back of it, which he
      turned to show me, were the words, "To my dear Mrs. MacAllister" (his mother) "from
      Peggy."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Peggy! How the years had flown! I had forgotten that they had ever called me so. I
      looked at myself in that little
      gold frame with eyes that saw through a mist.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It was Robert who broke the silence, and what he said was, "If any other man had done
      a thing like this—" He didn't say whether he meant bringing me there. but I had a
      swift prescience of the trail: it was the picture—"I'd have called him a sentimental
      fool."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>His troubled eyes searched mine; but I had been so shamed I had to turn away.</p>
   
   
   <p>"Put her away—that little thing," I said tremulously. "She makes me want to cry. That
      you should ever have wanted to put me in her place I can never understand."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Margaret!" Incredulous came his cry. But before he could put out his arms to me I
      had thrown myself into them. I was not to be outdone, now that head and heart agreed.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And so we were married—half an hour or so later. Then we came here to town to pack
      up a few necessary clothes. We are going to take the Hemingways' apartment for a time.
   </p>
   
   <p>God has been good to—Peggy. And I believe she will gradually oust that sophisticated,
      skeptical Margaret.

   <h4>New York's Most Famous Child Model</h4>
   
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>IN New York there is a girl model sixteen years old who has been posing for fourteen
         years. Her name is Irene Marcellus, and she has long been celebrated among artists
         as one of the most gifted child models in the profession.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Recently, however, she has shown marked ability in a new direction. A year ago she
         began to model in clay, and her first studies, shown lately in the Reinhardt Galleries,
         have interested and astonished New York sculptors.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Irene began to pose before she can remember. When she was two her mother, herself
         an excellent model, would put her on a stool and say, "Now sleep, baby." Down would
         go the curly head on the chubby arm in an irresistible parody of slumber.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>A Magazine Cover Girl</h4>
      
      
      <p>THE girl has posed all through her childhood and little girlhood for illustrators,
         photographers, and sculptors, for magazine covers, for calendars, for fashion magazines,
         even for classic designs for the decoration of public buildings. Posing has never
         tired or bored her, and her mother has seen to it that neither her health nor her
         schooling was neglected.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Says Sciarrino Pietro of her posing: "She has intelligence of a high order; indeed,
         I do not believe that beauty such as hers can exist without intelligence and feeling
         back of it. Many models have regularity of feature or symmetry of form; but what a
         difference it makes when an artist can secure a co-worker like Miss Marcellus, who
         knows intuitively and intellectually what it is he is driving at!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A year ago, during a rather difficult pose which kept her arms outstretched, Irene
         wanted something to occupy her mind, and asked for a bit of clay to play with while
         the sculptor worked. When she stopped for rest she showed him a

            <p>
               <em>She is sixteen, and has been posing for fourteen years.</em>

         tiny Venus, excellently proportioned, and executed with genuine originality. After
         that she was welcome to all the clay she wanted, and she would come early and stay
         late to work with it. Then she took some clay home and made herself tools out of a
         couple of wire hairpins and some old penholders. Her mother moved the dishes out of
         the three top shelves of the kitchen cupboard—and thus began Irene's atelier.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This spring "The Friends of Young Artists" held a competition, and Irene was urged
         to enter it. Mr. Pietro, for whom she was then posing, gave her a week off and all
         the materials she needed, and the girl worked literally from sunrise to sunset, and
         entered three studies of "War." None of them earned a prize, for they were faulty
         in technic, but, curiously enough, they attracted more attention than the prize winners.
         They were undisciplined, impetuous; but in spite of their size (they were the smallest
         things in the matter of square inches to be found in the exhibition) they were big.
         One felt the drive of an idea behind them.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Now Irene wants to model all the time; but so far it hasn't made her impatient with
         posing. There is a new interest for her now in watching sculptors at their work.
      </p>

   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>She Directed Her Own Education</h4>
      
      
      <p>IRENE has had from the start the advantage of directing her own education. When she
         saw copies of Greek sculpture in artists' studios, or heard Praxiteles, Phidias, Michelangelo,
         or Da Vinci familiarly and favorably spoken of, she went to a friend or to the library
         and found out just who these people were and what they did. Somehow after that she
         felt that she had to know about history, and that led to the desire to speak other
         languages, than the one she was born with in Connecticut. So she studied Latin with
         actual enthusiasm, and speaks Italian, French, and Spanish with increasing ease.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"It seems to me stupid to talk English when you are posing for an Italian," says Miss
         Marcellus wisely. "Why not take the opportunity to learn something?"

   <h4>Three Meals a Day for Three Cents</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>THERE is one class of citizens in New York whose members live within their incomes.
         For them the cost of living has literally been figured down to the last penny. These
         are the patrons of the one-cent coffee stands.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>At an hour when the apartment dweller uptown seeks respite from his financial burdens
         in one more nap, the three-cent-a-day citizen is fortifying himself for the day's
         activity (or lack of it) at a cost of one cent and a minimum of domestic care at the
         one-cent restaurant on West Eighth Street.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In the basement of a three-story house at 31 West Eighth Street is the one-cent restaurant,
         kitchen, and general headquarters of the St. Andrew's coffee stands. Here the one
         substantial meal of the day is served to a horde of the cold and hungry at six A.
         M. At this gray hour the long line assembles and surrounds the headquarters in a wild
         clamor for a one-cent breakfast. Hoboes, mothers with babies, and men out of work
         jostle one another in an effort to get a portion of hash with bread, a plate of beans,
         cereal, or fish cakes, their chief sustenance for another day. Here and there forlorn
         figures are seen hurrying away with a pitcher or bowl under a shawl for the little
         ones at home. Occasionally a decrepit old man or a woman with a baby is given a meal
         free; but the majority of these patrons pay one cent each. There is always an abundance
         of bread, and "seconds" may be had for the asking with a one-cent portion of soup,
         beans, or hash.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The central kitchen is a distributing center for the sub-depots or coffee stands,
         which are located throughout New York and Brooklyn. Their location is subject to change;
         but two permanent locations are at the Tombs and Jefferson Market.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>A Varied Bill of Fare for One Cent</h4>
      
      <p>BOTH stands and restaurant are open from six A.M. to five P.M. on week days, and from
         seven A.M. to one P.M. on Sundays. The stands are little booths erected at strategic
         points in the city, where food from the central kitchen can be distributed to the
         most needy and deserving. During these hours hundreds of the floating population who
         are wandering about the city looking for stray jobs depend upon the one-cent stand
         for sustenance. The bill of fare is rather extensive, and is changed frequently. It
         includes hot coffee, tea, or chocolate with bread, hot soup and bread, pork and beans,
         fish cakes, hot fish chowder, oatmeal, hominy, and sandwiches, a full portion of any
         of which costs one cent.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When a man has been out of work for several weeks he instinctively begins to patronize
         the cheap eating houses and coffee stands. Not long ago a young bookkeeper lost his
         job by reason of the failure of one of the large New York wholesale houses. He had
         been with the firm but a short time and had very few friends in the city. He tried
         in vain for more than a month to secure employment, meanwhile cutting down his expenses
         to the lowest figure consistent with his self-respect. At last he found himself down
         to his last nickel. It was then that he heard of the one-cent coffee stands. He found
         one, and his nickel lasted till he earned another. Then for weeks he lodged in the
         Jefferson Market district and ate at the one-cent stands, picking up some chance job
         during the day.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>One day at noon he was standing at the one-cent stand at the Tombs waiting his turn
         for a bowl of soup, when, glancing furtively round, as usual in fear of meeting some
         one he knew, he spied his old friend the head of the department. He was coming down
         the street, straight toward him. It was too late to shrink away; so he had to stand
         his ground. It was a trying ordeal; but in the end he realized that that encounter
         was a stroke of pure luck. It was the end of the one-cent meal; for his former employer
         knew of an opening in a furniture house, and the young bookkeeper began work next
         day, and finally worked his way into a position in the office.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>A God-send to the "Down and Outs"</h4>
      
      
      <p>IN the crowd that gathers daily in front of these stands at noon-hour you can see
         the counterpart of this young man in the midst of the down-and-outs, traces of his
         former self-respect still evident in spite of his ragged exterior. He is easily detected
         by his effort to shrink from your gaze.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As the actual cost of preparing and serving the food is considerably more than the
         sum received, the enterprise is a charitatable one. In order to make up the deficit
         incurred in maintaining these stands a benefit concert is given each year, and contributions
         are received from time to time from interested individuals. Strips of meal tickets
         at one dollar a hundred may be purchased also by the charitably inclined for distribution
         among the poor. One hundred hungry individuals fed for the price of one American Beauty
         rose!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>From a small beginning made by one woman twenty-seven years ago the St. Andrew's stands
         have become one of the established charities of Greater New York.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Scientific philanthropy has taught many new lessons; but it has not yet replaced the
         one-cent coffee stands.

   <h4>Two Women Wood-Choppers</h4>
   
   
   <p>MRS. ALONZO CLARK of South Hanover supports herself, her two children, and her invalid
      husband, by chopping wood. One winter she cut almost twenty-five cords of oak wood.
      She wields a three and a half pound ax as effectively as the germ-loving push-cart
      merchant wields the feather duster, and it is not unusual for her to cut and pile
      five or six feet of cord wood in a day.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Mrs. Clark loves wood-chopping well enough to make it her business all the year round.
      Olive Fremstad is only what might be called a half-time worker. She attends to business
      out in her Maine back lot all right during the summer months; but as soon as fall
      comes she goes off on a concert tour.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But, of course, there is money in Fremstad's concert tours—from $50,000 to $100,000
      a season—and singing is good
      
      
      
   </p>
   <p>
      <div class="inline_figure">
         <div class="p">[illustration]</div>

         <p>Mrs. Clark, who supports four people by chopping wood,</p>
         
         
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      
      enough exercise, too, though it doesn't keep you out in the open air as wood-chopping
      does.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Madame Fremstad's father was a Norwegian revivalist, and when he went out round Minnesota
      preaching

         <p>and Mme. Fremstaf, who chops her own firewood.</p>
         
         
      </div>
   </p>
   <p>
      
      he used to take his ten-year-old daughter with him to play the organ and lead the
      singing. When people start singing, it is often very hard to get them to stop. Olive
      Fremstad was eighteen when she landed in New York one stormy Christmas eve, with no
      money and no friends, but with the kind of determination that is only imported from
      the Scandinavian Peninsula.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After being very poor and working very hard, and saving money enough to go to Germany
      to study with, and coming back and getting a job at the Metropolitan Opera House,
      Fremstad the woodchopper ended by outraging the feelings of every critic in New York
      by changing herself from a contralto into the greatest dramatic soprano America has
      produced.

   <h4>Beatrice Herford Monologues About Herself</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>BEATRICE HERFORD, the monologist, whose impersonations of the woman buying theater
         tickets, the woman packing her trunk, etc., are known all over the country, has just
         gone into vaudeville. "My first audience," said Miss Herford, at the close of her
         first week in vaudeville in New York, "was my family. I was the youngest of nine children.
         My father was a preacher at the Arlington Street Church in Boston. Besides the family,
         there was a great deal of company at the house. I was always playing that I was somebody—the
         sewing woman, or a saleswoman who had waited on us in a shop. I particularly liked
         to be a rich lady, who had all sorts of things I didn't have. All children play like
         that, of course; and the only reason the family paid any attention to my impersonations
         was that I had a good verbal memory, a trick of remembering the characteristic phrases
         and intonations of the cleaning woman or the laundress. I made all the characters
         talk differently, and in such a way that my brothers and sisters could at once recognize
         whom I was 'doing.' They liked it, and used to coax me to do it to amuse their friends.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"That is just about what I do to-day. I give my audiences people they know. It's because
         it's true that they like my fun. I don't exaggerate, really; though sometimes I combine
         the absurdities of two or three people into one. Go into any wall-paper store, and
         you are likely to hear some woman being just as foolish as my woman in the monologue
         I call 'Selecting Wall-paper.'
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Miss Herford Is Also a Carpenter</h4>
      
      <p>"I GET a lot of things off my chest in my monologues, too—things that make me tired.
         I'm just finishing a new monologue in which I have the mistress tell the maid to put
         out the tea-spoons for tea, and remark that she 'needn't look for souvenir spoons,
         for there are none. Nobody will ever be called upon to run their tongue over Grant's
         Tomb or the Washington Monument in my house.'
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Sometimes," Miss Herford went on, "it does one a lot of good to speak one's mind
         about a little thing that's been nagging at one like that. I object to forms of art
         that interfere with domestic com-

         fort. Yes, I'm for comfort. Come up to my farm in Massachusetts and see for yourself.
         Plenty of cream and butter, yes. And then, I do carpentering to reduce.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Do you know that salesmen are often really interested in one's welfare? There's a
         place, down there near the theater, where I go for tea after the performance; and
         yesterday the waiter actually begged me not to eat another éclair, because they are
         so fattening. Wasn't that thoughtful?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I never get tired of playing. I make a play of my business. That's why I like it,
         and maybe that's why other people like it. No, I'm not nervous. I haven't been since
         I gave my first public performance in this country. I began giving monologues in England,
         at parties and in country houses. When I made my debut here, a black cat ran across
         the stage just before I began to speak. I am superstitious, and it upset me terribly.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"My brother Oliver was sitting in the front row, and he turned to the audience and
         explained: 'My sister has forgotten. This isn't a monologue, it's a catalogue.' That
         relieved the strain."

   <h4>Feminizing Electricity</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>ELECTRICITY, the well known phenomenon, has had to stand for a lot of ordering about
         from the human race since old Ben Franklin first got a line on it; but now that it's
         doing general housework for Miss Anita Baldwin it is really busy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>E.J. (Lucky) Baldwin accumulated millions with his spectacular mining and turf victories,
         and now his daughter is spending some of it by building and equipping "Anokia," near
         the Sierra Madre range.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Baldwin mansion probably illustrates the last word in the adaptation of electricity
         to the country house.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A six-ton refrigerating plant, operated by an electrical motor of 15 horsepower, produces
         three or four hundred pounds 
         of ice every day, and also chills the water distribution system of the house.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Even Hair-Driers</h4>
      
      
      <p>THE refrigerating plant is only one of a dozen features found in this house, features
         seldom installed outside of metropolitan hotels.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>An electric hair-drier is found in every dressing-room. It is a compressor, operated
         by a one-horsepower motor, that connects by air-pipes to each boudoir.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The repair shop has electrically operated machinery for doing everything needed to
         keep the motor cars in running order, from the slight detail of threading a nut or
         bolt to so big a job as rebuilding a chassis. A five-horsepower motor operates a lathe,
         drill-press, grinder, and other machinery usually found in a commercial garage of
         high class; while for cleaning the machines a vacuum cleaning outfit has been installed.
         There is another vacuum cleaning system installed in the house.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The electric laundry is another up-to-the-minute feature of this establishment, with
         machinery for cleaning and ironing the most delicate fabrics. Electric cooking is
         also in use at Anokia, and the odors of cooking are drawn out of the house by means
         of an electrically operated exhaust fan.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Light Distribution Specially Designed</h4>
      
      <p>INDIRECT lighting is used throughout the house, except where some particular decorative
         effect is obtained direct lights, and the fine lines of the entrance are illumined
         at night by mere than a score of specially designed bronze electroliers.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The night view of Anokia, with its setting of live-oaks and its impressive background
         of the Sierra Madre range, suggests at once the gaiety, grace, and joy that the builder
         must have planned in designing this California house.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>From a well at some distance from the house, a 40-horsepower motor connected with
         a centrifugal pump raises water le a concrete reservoir. Here a pressure pump operated
         by a 7-horsepower motor forces the water into an 1,800-gallon tank, whence the fluid
         is delivered at 50-pound pressure to the house, garage, and stables.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Only with one chore does electricity get any kind of assistance. Credit belongs to
         gravitation, for distributing the water needed for irrigation from the reservoir.
      </p>

   <h4>A Wise Jane</h4>
   
   <div class="byline">By 
      <span class="persName">FRANK GOEWEY JONESTHE</span> 
   </div>
   
   
   <p>THE pompous little president of the Ajax Electric Company bustled from the elevator
      to the testing department at the rear of the third floor of the factory. He fussily
      spread out a letter on the head inspector's desk and pointed to a paragraph.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"There's a little message from our Eastern manager to you, Miss Diekema," he said
      patronizingly. "Read it."
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>"For me?" exclaimed Jane in surprise. Her curious eyes swept the indicated part of
      the letter:
   </p>
   
   
   <blockquote>
      <p>Usually I'm not bashful about taking credit for orders I send in, but I must admit
         this one is due more to the perfect sample coils and the table of comparative tests
         accompanying them than to my salesmanship. "Head Inspector J.D." She's got brains.
      </p>
   </blockquote> 
   
   
   <p>"McBundy landed a big contract us," the president benignly informed the forewoman
      when she lifted her sparkling eyes. "Your samples were excellent, Miss Diekema—excellent!"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Barker always was in a hurry. He trotted off immediately after popping out his compliment.</p> 
   
   
   <p>Jane Diekema sat at the head inspector's desk because she prided herself on doing
      perfect work. But such genuine, unreserved appreciation of her conscientious carefulness
      had never before been given her. The girl tingled with pleasure.
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>"Jane" is a name that was intended by its designer to button down a ramrod back and
      to draw tight over skinny shoulders and a flat breast. All the twenty years of Jane
      Diekema's life her buxomness had strained at the severe lines of her unbecoming nominal
      dress. Now all at once the seams burst. "Jane" simply could not hold the girl after
      she had read that wonderful paragraph in McBundy's letter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>THE next evening the forewoman just tucked a chic 
      <em>e</em> into the basque of "Jane," then sewed the ruffle 
      <em>nette</em> to the skirt. Attired as "Jeannette" she need not feel abashed under metropolitan
      eyes.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She first wore her frilled patronymic in a letter that she wrote that night to McBundy.
      It was a conventional missive, unspoiled by any trace of gush. Jeannette's emotions
      were not frothier than Jane's had been. The forewoman modestly thanked the Eastern
      manager for his kind expressions regarding her. But a romantic heart thumped beneath
      the surface of the carefully chosen words. She wondered if alert New York ears could
      hear it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette did not tell any one that she had written to McBundy. The inditing of the
      letter was a secret adventure in romance. The forewoman never had laid eyes on the
      Eastern manager. She only
      
      
      
      had seen his photograph at a distance. It was one of a group of autographed pictures
      in the president's office. After she had mailed her thanks, the metamorphosed Jane
      stole into the untenanted sanctum and gazed for nearly five minutes at the fascinating
      photograph of her New York cavalier. Jeannette was surprised that she had not observed
      previously how very distinguished McBundy appeared in his picture. He had the thin,
      sharply cut features of a patrician. And he wore a pince-nez!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>How glad she was that she had signed "(Miss) Jeannette Diekema" to her letter! Suppose
      she had written "Jane," the work-aday name she scribbled on receipts for coils delivered
      by Joe Steketee for testing!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>AT the moment of her incidental thought of the young foreman of the assembling department,
      Steketee's tall, hard-muscled figure filled the doorway.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Hello, Jane! I see you've taken possession of headquarters. Got any orders for me
      this morning?" The foreman stepped across the threshold. In a lower, half serious,
      half merry tone he added, "Lord! it 'u'd be nice to have you boss me around!"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jane had grown accustomed to the foreman's doggedly persistent love-making. But Jeannette
      all at once took an active dislike to what had been merely matter of course to Jane.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"I do wish," she declared resentfully, "you'd quit being so ridiculous!" In a flash
      she switched from rebuke to curious inquiry: "Say, Joe, have you ever seen McBundy?
      Do you know what kind o' man he is?"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The foreman's gray eyes hardened. His glance flickered to the picture, then reverted
      to the girl's face. "Why do you want to know about him, Jane?"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The pinkness in Jane's cheeks deepened. "You remember I inspected those specimen coils
      we sent the New York office a couple of weeks ago. Well, McBundy wrote to Mr. Barker
      that the samples themselves landed the order. He's the first salesman I ever heard
      of who would give the factory any credit for helping make a sale, and I was kind o'
      curious to know what sort of a fellow he is." She laughed lightly and started out
      of the sanctum.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The foreman followed her in silence. His grim look did not relax. At the door
      
      
      
      he spoke. "Yes, I've seen McBundy—once. He came out to the factory three years ago.
      You wasn't working here then, I guess. " With bluntness almost explosive Steketee
      finished: "I don't like him."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette darted up a birdlike look at the lowering face of her companion. She half
      puckered her mouth to shape the curious question, "Why?" Then she locked her lips.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Joe did not speak again until they had traversed the general office. At the factory
      door, he started toward the shipping room, she in the direction of the elevator.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Well, good-by," he called after her.</p>
   
   
   <p>"Good-by, Joe," she answered. The words seemed to hold a significance that Jeannette
      did not mean. She added hastily: "I'll see you upstairs. I've got some broken coils
      for you to fix."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"All right." Steketee's deep voice had sounded dead before. Now it pulsed with vitality,
      like the throbbing of a drum after mufflers have been stripped from the sticks. "I'll
      be up in just a minute."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A quarter of an hour later they were finishing their scrutiny of the defective coils.
      Joe inserted into the discussion a topic that had nothing at all to do with assembling
      or testing.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Say, Jane, arbutus ought to be pretty near out, hadn't it?"</p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette had sharp ears. They caught the quaver of tense wistfulness in his tones.
      "Let's go down to the Lake Woods next Sunday and see," she granted.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>His face glowed with delight. "Lord, I hope it'll be a nice day!" he cried.</p>
   
   
   <p>THAT was Tuesday. On Saturday morning, directly after the postman made his first delivery
      to the Ajax Electric Company the forewoman contrived an errand to the office.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Letter for you, Jane!" the mail clerk sang out.</p>
   
   
   <p>The head inspector glanced keenly at the hand-addressed, plain, square envelop passed
      to her. It was postmarked "Madison Sq. Sta., N.Y."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Humph!" she dissembled. "Wonder what struck 
      <em>her</em> to write?"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette had scarcely dared to hope that the Eastern manager would pen her an autograph
      missive on his private correspondence paper. When she was back at her desk Jane cut
      the envelop and with tensely quivering fingers drew from its sheath a folded, double
      sheet of paper.
      
      
      
      It crackled open under her flinching eyes. Almost at a glance she read.
   </p>
   
   
   <div class="floatingText">
      
      
      <p>MY DEAR MISS DIEKEMA: You were jolly good to write me. I should express my appreciation
         more fully now but I have to run for a train in ten minutes, and am snatching this
         little time to reply to you. However, I expect to be at the factory next week—Monday
         probably. Then we'll shake hands and get better acquainted.
      </p>
      
      <div class="closer">
         <div class="salute">Hastily, </div> 
         <br></br>RANKIN MCBUNDY. 
      </div>
      
       
   </div>
   
   
   <p>A respiration swept out of Jeannette's breast like the genial current of air from
      a house door opened on a frosty morning. Her breath seemed to warm her benumbed romance
      back to tingling life.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>With eyes that first sparkled, then glowed, Jeannette read her letter again. McBundy
      actually was coming to see her! In two days more they should "get better acquainted!"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All the rest of that Saturday discipline in the inspection department was relaxed.
      The forewoman danced through her duties with her blonde head in a cloud.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>On Sunday morning, when she went with Joe to the Lake Woods for arbutus, her exuberant
      spirits still welled over. Manlike, Steketee misinterpreted Jeannette's ebullience,
      and was transported in consequence. If the alert girl had not checked his runaway
      hopes by sharp jerks whenever he gave rein to his ardor, he would have proposed to
      her again.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Joe was very grumpy on the street-car going back to town. Jeannette was glad when
      she reached home. Her escort handed her the big armful of fragrant blooms they had
      gathered, then abruptly tipped his derby and said good-by.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>THE factory siren screeched its five-minutes-to-seven warning as Jeannette latched
      the door of her wardrobe closet. At the call of responsibility she began walking briskly
      up and down the aisles of her department. It was her custom to make every morning
      an eagle-eyed, swift survey of all the testing tables.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>During the first half-hour of that morning Jeannette felt vixenish. She was unfortable
      in the knowledge that she had been unkind to Joe the day before. The testing and assembling
      departments shared the third floor, with no partition between them. From her desk
      she covertly observed the foreman. Joe remained most of the time at the far end of
      his department. Jeannette knew he was avoiding her. Presently the strained situation
      began to irritate her. Impulsively she decided to invade his territory and end the
      nervous ordeal.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She snatched up a handful of defective coil windings and started for the assembling
      department in a rush.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When Jeannette came to the railed-in
      
      
      <span class="hr"> </span>
      <span class="pageimage">

      </span>
      
      
      front corner that was Joe's sanctum the foreman did not rise from his seat. He received
      her merely as the forewoman, not at all as the girl to whom he had been on the point
      of proposing marriage the day before. He gave close but colorless attention to her
      ostensible errand. His whole interest seemed concentrated on the defective coils.
      Joe's manner told Jeannette that thereafter she should be treated solely as an inter-meshing
      cog in the factory machine of which he too formed a part.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Much obliged, Jane," he remarked in even tones. "Let me know if you get any more
      like these. I'll lay off that stupid Kelly girl if she keeps on turning out such bum
      work." He rose from his chair, nodded in parting, and walked away to reprimand the
      careless assembler.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>On her way back to her own desk Jeannette held her head rather higher than usual,
      while she told herself that she did not care a snap of her fingers for Joe Steketee,
      and that she was glad to be rid of the annoyance of his persistent lovemaking.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As she approached the inspection department her assistant, Lizzie, wriggled from the
      factory telephone.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Mr. Barker just 'phoned up that he's sending Joe an order to wind six of each kind
      of standard coils," said Lizzie. "He wants 'em tested soon's they come over here from
      the assemblers. He said you was to do it yourself, like you did on that New York office
      order a couple of weeks ago. McBundy's coming to the factory to-day, and he's got
      to have some samples to take back with 'im to New York."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"I knew about it," the forewoman replied, with the indulgent air of one who has advance
      information concerning all important business matters.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>JEANNETTE smiled and hummed to herself when she sat down at her desk. She unlocked
      a certain drawer and scanned McBundy's letter once more. Then her vision began to
      weave dreams. Her mind held no trace of the resentment she had felt toward the foreman.
      In fact, Miss Jeannette Diekema had entirely forgotten workaday Joe Steketee.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>During the next three hours of that morning she gave only a moiety of her attention
      to her duties. Half the time her bright glances were leaping to the elevator or to
      the stairway doors. Her expectations were not realized until after eleven o'clock;
      then the president stepped from the elevator with a tall, distinguished looking man.
      Jeanette instantly recognized McBundy.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She was sitting before her desk. She turned her profile toward the center aisle; for
      the side view of her face was the prettiest.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A minute—two minutes—three—Jeannette held her pose rigidly. No one approached from
      the front end of the room. She peeped sidewise under her lowered eyelids. What she
      glimpsed through her lashes made her lift her head. With apparent casualness she looked
      in the direction of the assembling department.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy stood at Steketee's railing with Barker. The president was talking animatedly
      to the foreman. Jeannette smiled her comprehension of the situation. Of course Barker
      had taken his visitor first to the department nearer the elevator.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>While Jeannette watched covertly, the Eastern manager turned with a bored air from
      the two other men. His eyes wandered about searchingly. Manifestly he sought some
      particular face.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Barker started in the direction of the experimental laboratory, which adjoined the
      assembling department, beckoning the foreman to follow him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy took a leisurely step or two in their wake, then changed his mind and sauntered
      toward the opposite side of the room. He still was looking, looking. Jeannette guessed
      that he searched for the girl who had written to him. It was quite clear to her that
      he expected to find the head inspector among Steketee's winders. Jeannette chuckled
      as her eyes followed the blundering seeker. She thrilled with the tense excitement
      of the hunted; but this
      
      
      
      quarry was not in the least degree afraid of the hunter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Wilhelmina, a pretty little Dutch girl in Joe's department, happened to be working
      alone that day beside a front corner window. Her solitary location singled her out
      from the rest of the girls. McBundy paused beside Wilhelmina's chair and peered at
      her appraisingly.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The forewoman at the rear of the room watched the tableau with mixed emotions. She
      guessed that the Eastern manager had jumped to the conclusion that Wilhelmina was
      the head inspector because she sat apart. Queenly Jeannette was not afraid of later
      comparison with the doll-like "beauty of the assembling department"; yet she was piqued
      by the man's expression of admiration.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBUNDY looked over his shoulder toward the experimental laboratory, inside which
      the president and the foreman had disappeared. He reverted to Wilhelmina, stooped,
      and spoke to her.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The pretty assembler jumped in her chair, evidently startled by the strange voice.</p>
   
   
   <p>"Doll-baby!" the forewoman sneered. "She's blushing too! The little flirt thinks he's
      interested in her!"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette smiled contemptuously at self-deluded Wilhelmina. Complacently she waited
      for the assembler to tell McBundy that he was mistaken in her identity and to indicate
      where he might find Miss Diekema. Her heart began to beat fast. In just a minute the
      forewoman would be shaking hands with the Eastern manager.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But Wilhelmina did not twist round at once and point her out to him, as Jeannette
      had expected. Nor did McBundy lift his eyes in curiosity and stare toward the back
      of the room. On the contrary, he picked up the winding on which Wilhelmina had been
      working. He bent his aristocratic head closer to her straw-colored curls. Apparently
      he asked a question. Wilhelmina giggled, then chattered volubly in response. They
      talked for several minutes like old friends.
   </p>

         <em>"'You're certainly a wise Jane,' he blurted. 'I shouldn't wonder if you could teach
            me a lot of things.'"
         </em>
      </p>
       
      
   </div>
   
   
   
   
   <p>Just then Steketee appeared in the laboratory door.</p>
   
   
   <p>"McBundy!" he called. "Mr. Barker wants you to come here."</p>
   
   
   <p>There was an unaccountable, menacing harshness in the foreman's tone. He was glaring
      ferociously at the Eastern manager and the pretty winder. McBundy had glanced up at
      the summons.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Be there in a minute," he answered.</p>
   
   
   <p>He stooped close to Wilhelmina again and whispered to her. She nodded her head slightly.
      The Eastern manager smiled and started toward the laboratory.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>JUST at that moment Lizzie exasperated  the forewoman by coming to her desk with a
      trayful of "rush" coils and a question regarding their disposition. The attention
      of the head inspector perforce was diverted to official duties.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Take 'em down to be packed!" she snapped. "Wait till I get you the shipping order."</p>
   
   
   <p>She rummaged half a minute in a drawer before she could find the requisition she wanted.
      She crossly thrust the paper at her assistant, and looked toward the front of the
      room again.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy was entering the laboratory door. Joe now stooped close to Wilhelmina. The
      little assembler's face was raised to 
      her foreman. Her cheeks were twin flames while she listened to what he was saying.
      Steketee talked rapidly for more than a minute. From his manner and Wilhelmina's look,
      Jeannette judged that "Doll-baby" was being sharply reprimanded for wasting time in
      idle chatter.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Serves her right!" she muttered.</p>
   
   
   <p>Suddenly Joe finished what he was saying, and stood expectantly beside the corner
      work bench. Then, to Jeannette's amazement, a radiant smile beamed on Wilhelmina's
      face. The Dutch girl delightedly bobbed her head to Steketee.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>All at once the watching forewoman comprehended that the crimson of her cheeks was
      a blush of happiness. She was utterly bewildered. McBundy's conduct had been strange
      enough; but what
      
      
      
      on earth could the foreman have said to Wilhelmina that had brought that ecstatic
      expression to her face? Manifestly he had not scolded her at all! Vainly she racked
      her brains for an adequate answer to the puzzling question. Joe walked to his sanctum
      and sat down at his desk.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Barker bounced in his abrupt way through the laboratory door, McBundy following him.
      The president said something to the Eastern manager. The New Yorker replied. They
      turned into the center aisle and walked toward the rear of the room. Jeannette's heart
      leaped; she thought they were coming over to her desk.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>No sooner had she made the guess than her delight was smothered. The elevator happened
      to be passing the third floor. Barker hailed the operator. He and McBundy wheeled
      to the cage, entered, and plunged from sight.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette slumped into her chair. Tears of vexation welled in her eyes.</p>
   
   
   <p>Just then the telephone summoned the forewoman to the stock-room on urgent business.
      When she returned to her desk, all the girls had gone to the lunch-room.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette had no appetite. She leaned back in her chair and pondered the inexplicable
      behavior of McBundy, of Joe, and, of Wilhelmina. She could find neither head nor tail
      of the enigma. Previously she had been sure that she understood the Eastern manager's
      real purpose in beginning a chat with the pretty winder. Now she was dubious.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>And what had made Joe scowl blackly when he detected the New Yorker talking with the
      girl? And what could he have said to Wilhelmina that had appeared scare her first,
      then had made her rapturously happy?
   </p>
   
   
   <p>DURING three fourths of that noon hour Jeannette puzzled futilely over the complex
      problem. Then, about ten minutes before one o'clock, her rattle-brained assistant
      brought the first clue to the mysterious occurrences of the morning. Lizzie came back
      from her lunch arm in arm with Wilhelmina. The two chums parted at the elevator. The
      winder skipped toward her work bench as her feet were winged; the head inspector's
      assistant pelted to her chief. Besides the three there was no one on the third floor.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Oh, Jane, you never could guess!" panted the testing department factotum.</p>
   
   
   <p>"What?" inquired Jeannette without interest.</p>
   
   
   <p>"Joe's going to take Meenie to a picture show to-night!"</p>
   
   
   <p>"What?" The question now snapped from Jeannette's taut lips like a bark.</p>
   
   
   <p>Lizzie's shallow head was full of the marvel of her news. She could not discriminate
      between the involuntary cry of hurt and an exclamation of astonishment.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"No wonder you're su'prised," she rattled on. "So was I when Meenie told me. And she
      said anybody could've knocked her over with a feather when Joe asked her. Right in
      working hours it was too—only a little while before noon. Meenie's always thought
      a lot of Joe; but he never much more than spoke to her before. She thought you and
      him were keeping company."
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>The elevator disgorged a dozen chattering girls returned from the lunch-room. Lizzie
      whirled at the clang of the iron door, and saw Wilhemina dart toward the bevy. She
      evidently divined Wilhelmina's purpose to spread the secret. She bolted in order to
      enjoy the sensation with her bosom friend.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Behind her Jeannette sat staring blankly. Of course she was perfectly sure she did
      not love Joe herself; therefore it made no difference to her if he did start "going"
      with another girl. Nevertheless, when she realized that Steketee actually had begun
      paying to some one else, and a very pretty some one else, the attentions he had been
      wont to devote to herself, Jeannette was thoroughly miserable.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Then in a flash she salved her burning sense of personal injury. Suddenly she guessed
      Joe's reason for inviting Wilhelmina to go with him to a picture show. Jeannette's
      lips twisted and her nose wrinkled.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Thinks he'll make me jealous!" she

      sneered to herself in a hissing whisper. "I'll show him!"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She had been so astounded by her assistant's prattle about Wilhelmina and Joe that
      temporarily she had forgotten McBundy. Now thoughts of him recurred. Sometime that
      afternoon undoubtedly he would resume his interrupted quest for her. A baleful light
      gleamed from her eyes as she planned to "show" Steketee.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Four hours of feverish impatience dragged by before her opportunity came. From apparently
      casual inquiries at the office Jeannette had learned shortly after the noon hour that
      the president and the Eastern manager had gone downtown together for lunch. They did
      not return to the factory until after two o'clock. Then they went into Barker's sanctum
      for a long conference.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The forewoman meanwhile held herself aloof from the fickle foreman. But she watched
      Joe like a hawk. Twice that afternoon she saw him pause briefly at the front corner
      work bench and speak to the pretty winder. Both times Wilhelmina looked up into his
      face with happy blushes.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>A LITTLE after five o'clock, when Jeannette sat at her desk in a despairing rage at
      the long delay of her reprisal for Joe's flirting, a voice at her shoulder startled
      her to her feet.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Isn't this Miss Diekema? I beg your pardon! I did not mean to frighten you."</p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy had come up to her desk alone. Jeannette reddened with vexation at herself
      for being taken by surprise after all her expectant waiting. Then she gulped and jerked
      back into sangfroid. As she held out her hand to the Eastern manager, she glanced
      beyond him to the front of the long room. She chuckled. The foreman was scowling at
      her over the railing round his desk.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"You did scare me a little," she admitted merrily; "but I'll forgive you, seeing you
      look so innocent."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy squeezed her plump, pink fingers in his slender palm. He retained her hand
      while he put a question: "You know who I am?"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Mr. Rankin McBundy, Esquire, Eastern manager of the Ajax Electric Company of Kemusgon,
      Michigan, U.S.A.," Jeannette replied mischievously. She wanted to show him something
      too.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy threw back his head and laughed so heartily that all the girls in the testing
      department twisted round in their chairs.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette was oblivious of her immediate surroundings; but she was delightedly aware
      that distant Joe strained toward her over his railing like an enraged bull-dog at
      the end of his chain. But, though she thrilled with the realization that she had "shown"
      him, that keen satisfaction was secondary now. The ardent look in McBundy's gray eyes,
      the dulcet sound of his voice, the tingling touch of his hand, electrified her. She
      did not need to 
      <em>act</em> happy!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"And your very humble slave," the gallant New Yorker added to the titles she had dubbed
      him with. After another lingering pressure of her fingers he reluctantly let them
      slip from his grasp. "I'm mighty glad to meet you and to find you're human. Do you
      know, Miss Diekema, I'd got an idea you were just a sort of infallible testing machine."
   </p>
   
   
   
   
   <p>"It depends on what I'm testing," she murmured with purposeful daring. She had thought
      of Joe again. "Sometimes I'm almost human."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She wanted to prove that a small-town girl could hold her own in repartee with a city
      gentleman.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy peered at her quizzically. "Fine work!" he exclaimed after a moment or two.
      "Best I ever saw. Couldn't be better, in fact. You'll do, sister!"
   </p> 
   
   
   <p>Though she matched his laugh, Jeannette did not like his tone, his words, or his look.
      She tossed her head, slightly supercilious. "Much obliged! Oh, there's a few things
      I know."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The New Yorker's gaze again questioned the unwavering eyes of the Kemusgon girl. There
      was hard-pointed

   <p>
      
      keenness in his stare. It seemed to stab like a sword blade into Jeannette's thoughts.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"You're certainly a wise Jane," he blurted in a voice discreetly low, so that none
      of the other girls could hear. He backed away with an affectation of sudden wariness.
      "I guess they don't make them any wiser than you. I shouldn't be
      surprised if you could teach me a lot of things—and I've been around a little, at
      that. Sorry I haven't time to take some lessons; but I just got a telegram, and have
      to hurry back to New York on the first train in the morning. It's too bad that I made
      an engagement for this evening."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>McBundy glanced toward the front of the room; then he stepped quickly for-
      
      
      
      ward and reached for Jeannette's hand again.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Good-by," he said hastily. "Ever so glad I've seen you, Miss Jeannette. Look me up
      if you come to New York any time."
   </p>
   
   
   <p>He pumped her arm briskly, turned away, and hurried up the aisle toward the elevator.</p>
   
   
   <p>JEANNETTE could not have been more  astounded had he slapped her face. For a moment
      or two she was so dazed that she only blinked stupidly after McBundy. Then comprehension
      flooded her brain with a swiftly risen tide of angry shame. Her eyes and her teeth
      snapped. Her fingers stiffened into curved claws. The enraged girl half crouched,
      as if she meant to leap, panther-like, on the debonair man and tear his insolence
      from him.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Then she recalled her surroundings. Her flaming cheeks blanched in a second. Furtively
      she glanced to right and left. Her girls had eyes only for the elegantly graceful
      back of McBundy. All work in the testing department had ceased.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The forewoman dropped into her chair and gropingly picked up a test record. Her romantic
      castle of dreams had been blasted by a lightning bolt and reduced to a heap of filthy
      ashes. She shivered as if a chill wind blew over her. She caught her breath wincingly.
      Then a deep, rushing sigh swept away even the ashes. The bleak, hard road of work
      stretched ahead into the interminable distance. She dragged herself to her feet and
      began plodding along it wearily.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Lizzie, take these inspection reports to the office."</p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette did not let her hard eyes stray from her department during the next half-hour.
      She went about her work grimly until the six o'clock whistle blew. McBundy's stunning
      blow to her pride had the effect of a partial anodyne. She was just beginning to feel
      the terrible pain at her heart. A spasm of agony wrenched her white lips as she stared
      after the last cluster of girls that crowded into the elevator.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She saw Wilhelmina, and forgot McBundy when she remembered Joe.</p>
   
   
   <p>She writhed in her chair, alone in the big factory room. As though the virus of poison
      ivy worked in the blood of her face, jealousy distorted her features. The veins bulged
      at her temples. Her color was livid.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"I hate you! Oh, I just hate you!" ground from between her teeth.</p>
   
   
   <p>The elevator door clanged shut. The cage fell swiftly. Suddenly the electric lights
      were switched off; the spring dusk filled the empty third floor. Still Jeannette gripped
      the edge of her desk; still her eyes stared straight ahead down the aisle.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>THEN footsteps clattered up the back stairs. The rear door burst open. Joe strode
      across the floor to the forewoman's desk. Jeannette rose from her chair stiffly and
      with nervously shaking fingers began putting away her shop orders.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Jane, what did that fellow McBundy say to you?" Steketee demanded harshly.</p>
   
   
   <p>She laughed in his face for answer.</p>
   
   
   <p>Joe clutched her arm. He thrust his blazing eyes close to the coldly scornful orbs
      that gleamed at him in the half dark. "Did he ask you to meet him to-night?" he snarled.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>She jerked herself free. "Supposing he did?" she spat. "How is that any of your business?
      You've got a date with pretty little Meenie, haven't you? What concern is it of yours
      where I'm going, or who I go with?"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"I'll make it my concern!" growled the foreman. "Neither you or any other decent girl
      in this factory is going to meet that whelp tonight if I can prevent it. That's why
      I asked Wilhelmina to go to the movies with me. I saw McBundy flirting with her, and
      knew what he was up to. I got next to his system when he was here three years ago;
      but I was too late that time. Meenie would have gone out to-night if I hadn't asked
      her. The little idiot is struck on me, so she's going back on the promise she made
      McBundy to meet him. Meenie hasn't got any sense; but I never thought that New York
      dude could pull the wool over your eyes until I saw the way you talked to him. Oh,
      Jane!" Steketee's harsh voice broke pitifully. "I can't believe yet you'd have anything
      to do with a cur like him!"
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Jeannette was trembling all over, like a frosted rose-bush touched by the first breath
      of a sun-warmed breeze. She reached up both her arms and put her hands on Joe's shoulders.
      The man caught her to him convulsively.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Silly!" she whispered. "Didn't you see I turned McBundy down?"</p>

         <h4>SYNOPSIS OF PRECEDING CHAPTERS</h4>
         
         <p>GUY AMARINTH, very much in love with a young girl of his acquaintance, Marie Dupont,
            one night persuades her to run away from a ball and marry him. They have hardly concluded
            this impulsive act when Amarinth discovers to his dismay that his young wife has a
            very ambiguous past.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>From her guardian, Hugh Senior, he learns that Marie's real identity is unknown. Seven
            years before Senior was motoring early one morning in Paris when he accidentally ran
            down a girl in the street. He carried her to his aunt's home, and in a day or two
            she recovered; but she had lost all memory of her life up to the time of the accident.
            No inquiries could unearth her identity. She was dressed at the time as a Paris working
            girl; but round her neck was a curious necklace, apparently of paste. Senior and his
            aunt, feeling responsible for the girl's situation, adopted her and called her Marie
            Dupont.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>Young Amarinth is disagreeably affected by this revelation. Mysterious hints have
            already come to him that Marie resembles a professional dancer of not too flawless
            reputation who used to dance in Paris cafés. When Senior shows him the necklace that
            was found on Marie's neck, Amarinth declares that the stones are genuine.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>To decide the question, he takes the necklace to a famous jeweler to be examined.
            He is startled a little later to receive a telephone message from the jeweler, saying
            that the firm took the liberty of displaying the necklace in their window, and that
            it has been claimed by a Rumanian, who swears that it was stolen seven years before
            in Paris. This Rumanian is Count Egon Szemere.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>He tells Amarinth and Hugh Senior that the necklace was the chief treasure of the
            Rumanian royal house; that it was sent to Paris, to be remodeled, in charge of himself
            and Prince Lascar; that in Paris the Prince became infatuated with a dancer, Alix
            Floria, and lent her the necklace to wear. A scandal occurred; the Prince was ordered
            back to Rumania. But the following day he was found stabbed in a ditch twenty miles
            from Paris, the woman supposed to be Alix Floria herself was found stabbed in her
            apartment, her face mutilated beyond recognition; and the necklace had disappeared.
            At the trial some doubt was cast on the identity of the murdered woman, as one of
            the witnesses testified that she had seen Floria the morning after the murder. As
            the Count finishes his story, Marie Dupont enters the room. She apparently fails to
            recognize the Count, but he is overcome by her resemblance to the supposedly murdered
            dancer.

      <h4>CHAPTER XV</h4>
      
      <p>"An extraordinary story, Mr. Senior!" Count Szemere exclaimed when Hugh had related
         the history of Marie Dupont in much the same words that had conveyed it that morning
         to Guy Amarinth. "Frankly, were it not for my confidence in you, I should hardly credit
         it."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Here are the papers that will hear me out," said Hugh. "This is a record, made by
         my aunt, of the opinions of the specialists consulted, and notes of her personal observations
         of the case. These others are letters from various persons who came into direct contact
         with the girl,—physicians, the nurse at the sanatorium, the head mistress in the school
         she attended. Surely these must convince you that it is a genuine case of loss of
         memory."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Szemere looked through the papers, pausing now and then to read parts of the writing.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Surely these must convince you," Hugh repeated when the papers were handed back to
         him.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The Count shrugged. "Women are sometimes very, very clever!"</p>
      
      
      <p>"But what in Heaven's name had she to gain?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"Ah, who knows?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"But what has she gained?"</p>
      
      
      <p>The Rumanian glanced at Amarinth. "She is about to contract a very desirable marriage,
         is she not?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Hugh made a sound of impatience. "You think she counted on that from the start? Why,
         she was a child!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"In years, yes; but hardly in—experience. Pardon me, Mr. Amarinth, if I seem to offend.
         For you have my respect and sympathy. I would gladly have spared you all knowledge
         of the past career of—Miss Dupont, had that been possible. But when I told to you
         the story of the dancer at the Purple Pigeon I could not know—"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I understand." Guy interrupted shortly. "Don't apologize."</p>
      
      
      <p>"She was no more prepared than you were for the meeting here this afternoon; yet she
         didn't betray the slightest sign of recognition. That must convince you, I should
         think," Hugh said.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"As to that, I am not convinced—not quite, you see—that she was not prepared."</p>
      
      
      <p>HUGH stared. "I don't understand you."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Pardon. I make no accusation. But before we left your office to come here you had
         been for a quarter-hour in another room. In that room there was perhaps a telephone—Oh,
         I make no accusations. I say only that you had the opportunity, had you wished—"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"You're right: I could have warned her. But the fact is that when I brought you here
         I had the hope that if she were this Alix Floria the sight of you might be a great
         enough shock to restore her memory. A shock might do it, the doctors said. I said
         to myself that if she did not know you, either she was not Alix Floria, or—"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"She is Alix Floria. Of that there is no doubt," Szemere put in.</p>
      
      
      <p>"An hour ago you said there was no doubt that Alix Floria was dead. You may be mistaken
         again."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"How can that be?" the Count cried excitedly. "She is Floria in face, and was she
         not wearing the necklace? What proof could there be more? But tell me this: How could
         you think I would so affect her when the necklace had not?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"She has never seen it."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Ah! And why?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"She never asked for it, and I thought it had no value. For seven years it's been
         in that drawer there, locked up sometimes, sometimes not."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"My God!" said the Count. His horrified gaze rose from the drawer to Hugh's face.
         Suddenly he leaned forward. "Show it to her now," he said.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <p>"No," said Hugh. "I shall turn the necklace over to the owner as soon as it has been
         positively identified by the Rumanian government. Owing to its great value I must
         insist upon that. Well, you gain your object, the recovery of the neckace. What more
         can you want?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"The cross, Mr. Senior."</p>
      
      
      <p>"I know nothing about that."</p>
      
      
      <p>"She knows."</p>
      
      
      <p>"She may have once; she doesn't now."</p>
      
      
      <p>"The sight of the necklace may recall it."</p>
      
      
      <p>"I don't wish it recalled!"</p>
      
      
      <p>Hugh was aware that he had spoken defiantly. He meant defiance. If the girl's past
         was what Szemere had said, then she should never know it if he could keep that knowledge
         from her. The risk he had taken in confronting her with the Count now appeared to
         him as monstrous. But he had not for a moment really believed that she was Alix Floria.
         He realized that now, now that her identity with the dancer seemed a proved fact.
         But he would take no further risks, either for Szemere's satisfaction or for Amarinth's.
         Amarinth must take her as she was or leave her. Far better that she should lose him
         than lose her virginal unconsciousness of whatever horrors lay imprisoned in her memory.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Let me explain," he went on as Szemere was about to speak. "This girl is my ward—I
         use the
         
         
         
         word in its truest sense. I am responsible for the condition in which you find her.
         She had her place in life, and through me she lost it. I have given her another, and
         I do not mean to let her lose it through you or any one else. What her life was prior
         to the moment that my car struck her senseless that morning I don't know. But what
         it has been since I do know; for she has lived it in my sight, day after day, for
         years. She may have been all that you say,
         
         
         
         Count Szemere,—a professional dancer in a low-class theater in Paris, a girl who flaunted
         the jewels of a Prince and—paid for the privilege. I can't deny anything. I don't
         know. But I do know this: that, vicious as her past may have been, not a trace of
         it remains in her consciousness to-day, not a trace. In an instant the slate of her
         mind was wiped clean."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He had turned from the Count and let his glance dwell on Amarinth; but the young man,
         after meeting his eyes for a moment, resumed his tight-lipped contemplation of the
         floor.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Some one has said wisely that we are only the sum total of our thoughts," Hugh went
         on. "And the thoughts of this girl are the thoughts of any young girl of pure, honorable
         life. What but shame and misery could the resurrection of an ignoble past bring to
         her? How can you dream that I would permit it?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"An operation would have had that result, and you have told me you thought of that,"
         the Count said.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I have not considered it since I have realized all that it might entail, nor will
         I, risk the enlightenment that the sight of the necklace might bring. I am responsible
         for her happiness, and I will guard it with all the power I have. Certainly I will

   <h4>Women Who Earn $10,000 a Year</h4>
   
   
   <div class="note">IT is not more than seventy-five years ago that one of the most famous women writers
      in the English language—Charlotte Brontë—was glad to get a position as governess at
      a salary of twenty pounds, or about a hundred dollars, a year. Women's salaries have
      not yet reached their high-water mark, but they have considerably improved since Charlotte
      Brontë's time. Here are the stories of five women whose achievements fairly represent
      the splendid opportunities that business offers women to-day.
   </div>
   
   
   <div class="inline_figure">
      <div class="p">[illustration]</div>
      
      <span class="head"></span>
      
      <p>Miss Jane Johnston Martin is said to be the best paid woman in the field of advertising.
         She earns more than $10,000 a year.
      </p>
       
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>IN artistic callings women who earn large incomes are rather plentiful. In business
         this does not seem to be true as yet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Geraldine Farrar, who earns between one hundred and two hundred thousand a year from
         opera and concerts, Madame Schumann-Heink, Louise Homer; Frances Hodgson Burnett,
         Alice Hegan Rice, and Mary Roberts Rinehart; Mary Pickford and Maude Adams: all these
         women earn anywhere from fifty to one hundred thousand a year. But apparently there
         are not any women in business—at least not on salaries—who are in this class of earners.
         The reason, perhaps, is that women in business are new and haven't developed. But
         the opportunity seems to exist—a vast opportunity that will in time draw the expert
         services of numberless women.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>At the present time it is inspiring to know that we have in this country a good many
         women who are earning, on salary or commission, ten thousand dollars a year or thereabouts.
         They are not easy to find, for they are not much in the limelight; but here is a group
         of five of them.

      <h4>From Candy-Making to "Ad"-Writing</h4>
      
      
      <p>IN a former article I told about a girl who made candy. Here is another one whose
         story begins that way, but ends very differently. Miss Nancy Vincent McClelland lived
         in Poughkeepsie, New York. She wanted to attend Vassar College, in that city, and,
         to get the money, began to make candy at home, selling it about town. Her enterprise
         attracted the attention of Frederick F. Thompson, the benefactor of Vassar, and he
         bestowed a scholarship on her, as he had on other girls who showed grit.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Miss McClelland graduated from Vassar in 1897. She had meant to teach Latin, but instead
         she went into newspaper work. She applied at a number of newspaper offices, and landed
         a job as reporter on the Philadelphia 
         <em>Press</em> at eight dollars a week.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>Then, in the Spanish-American War, she was a Red Cross nurse at an army camp in the
         United States.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>After she was back on the Philadelphia 
         <em>Press</em>, Miss McClelland was sent one day to interview John Wanamaker. To get to him required
         enterprise and patience, but she arrived.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>Soon afterward, in 1901, this young woman received an invitation to call at the Wanamaker
         store. She was getting something more than thirty dollars a week from the 
         <em>Press</em>, but now she took a job at Wanamaker's at forty, as an advertisement writer.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In 1906 she was sent to Europe by Wanamaker's, to study the products of the Continent.
         She was attached to the Paris office, and traveled a great deal. For seven years she
         remained abroad most of the time, doing various things for Wanamaker's. She edited
         a house pub-
         
         
         
         lication over there, and, in her own time, wrote a life of Napoleon for children.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Since her return to America in 1913 Miss McClelland says she has been doing "general
         housework" at Wanamaker's in New York. Her friends say she is one of the most original
         characters in that huge store. She has shown that merchandising offers to women at
         attractive field, if they will put ideas into their work.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Miss McClelland has originated many things, and put them through. She conceived the
         School Children's Art Contest in the Philadelpiha store, and hers was the idea that
         started the Personal Service Bureau. She superintends the art work and the stage exhibitions
         in the store auditorium; and she designs special furniture and lighting fixtures.
         She writes the French part of advertisements sometimes and has made a hit with French
         headings. She originated what she calls the "super-store," one of the most attractive
         of the departments. She started the School and College Service Bureau, and a great
         many things in the big store are first referred to her. Hers is the intimate touch.
         Ideas!

      <h4>A Woman Banker</h4>
      
      
      <p>IN Brookline, Massachusetts, lived a girl named Alice Carpenter. Her people had means,
         and she graduated from Smith College. Then she traveled abroad, and later became interested
         in social settlement work in Boston. She investigated such things as a strike of shirtwaist
         makers, and entered the suffrage movement. In 1912 she was appointed a member of a
         woman's committee at the convention of the Progressive party in Chicago, and spoke
         in ninety different places in the West.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>All this time she was managing a comfortable fortune that had descended to her. She
         studied the subject of investments, and handled her affairs with caution.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>In 1914 Miss Carpenter came to New York to consider several opportunities that had
         developed in business lines. She was inclined toward business, and wanted something
         that would give her ideas a chance for free play.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It was about this time that the banking house of William P. Bonbright &amp; Co., in New
         York, decided to open a woman's department, and to put a woman at the head of it.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>Opportunity is, indeed, a curious thing. This house wanted a level-headed woman of
         discernment, who had experience in managing investments. Miss Carpenter was such a
         woman, and she came to the attention of these bankers. She is now
         
         
         
         in charge of this work, and many stories are told of her success. Last April she went
         to The Hague as a delegate to the Peace Conference.
      </p>

   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>A Story of Ups and Downs</h4>
      
      
      <p>JUMP back some twenty years, to Chicago.</p>
      
      
      <p>May O'Connor lived there, and one day she applied at "The Fair" department store for
         work. She was twelve years old—that was when the child-labor laws were more lenient.
         They took her on as a cash-girl.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>She became a wrapper six months later, and then a cashier. Then there was a shake-up,
         and she was "let out." After a brief period with another store, she left to go to
         the fur store of D'Ancona &amp; Co. This house subsequently opened a store in New York,
         and Miss O'Connor was sent there.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The story of her ups and downs is too long for this narrative. But all the while she
         was studying merchandise. At one period she worked at the Siegel-Cooper store in New
         York, where she met and married Richard Haugan, a buyer. Then she was offered a position
         as buyer for a Pittsburgh store, and flitted between that city and New York. Later
         she was a buyer for the O'Neill-Adams store in New York. Her salary had now grown
         to $5,000 a year.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When Gimbel Brothers opened their big department store in New York in 1910, they sent
         for Mrs. Haugan and offered her a salary of $3,500, together with a percentage of
         sales over a certain figure. It was "up to" her how much she should make. The first
         year her commissions alone were $4,100.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>I shall not attempt to draw any picture of the tremendous aggregate effort that has
         made this energetic woman successful; but her story, like that of Miss McClelland,
         shows that merchandising offers women a great opportunity if they study it as men
         do.

      <h4>Newspaper Weeps and Trills</h4>
      
      <p>DOWN on a farm partly in Tennessee and partly in Kentucky there once lived a young
         girl named Elizabeth Meriwether. Later she moved with her parents to Clarksville,
         Tennessee, where she got the idea of becoming a writer. At twenty she married George
         Gilmer, and soon afterward they moved to Mississippi. Here she chanced to meet Elizabeth
         J. Nicholson, of the New Orleans 
         <em>Picayune</em>. The result was the publication of a story by Mrs. Gilmer in the 
         <em>Picayune</em>. 
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      <div class="inline_figure">
         <div class="p">[illustration]</div>
         
         <span class="head"></span>
         
         <p>Miss Alice Carpenter managed her own investments so well that a New York bank decided
            to put her at the head of its women's department.
         </p>
          
         
      </div>
      
      
      <p>Maybe this was chance; but work and ability usually find more one chance. Other stories
         followed in the 
         <em>Picayune</em> and in various periodicals; and then the message came from the 
         <em>Picayune</em>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Come down and work for us."</p>
      
      
      <p>She went—at ten dollars a week. The she got fifteen dollars, and later twenty dollars.
         They sent her out first to "cover" a funeral, and afterward the stage had a lot of
         fun because she wept delightfully in print.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It was a new style, anyway, that she put over, as the saying is. New Orleans liked
         it, and Mrs. Gilmer inaugurated two special departments for which wrote in her own
         way. In looking about for a nom de plume under which she could weep and laugh as much
         as she pleased. Then she remembered that an old negress had called her husband "Dix."
         She took that name and put "Dorothy" in front of it because she liked the name. That
         was how "Dorothy Dix" happened.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Up in New York there were song newspaper men who read the New Orleans 
         <em>Picayune</em>, and they liked the sound those weeps and trills of laughter. Would Dorothy come
         to New York at seventy five dollars a week?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>To-day she is one of the highest paid women in newspaper work—a little woman with
         dark eyes, who reports murder or love, and likes to tell jokes on herself.

      <h4>The Best Paid Woman in Advertising</h4>
      
      <p>ABOUT twenty years ago a girl named Jane Johnston Martin studied stenography in New
         York, where she lived, and found a position with A. B. Scott, patent-medicine man.
         For seven year she worked along steadily but without great progress, and then she
         was made her employer's private secretary.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The proprietor went to Europe, as he often did, on the company's business, and was
         gone six months. It fell to Miss Martin's lot to look after the advertising. While
         he was gone she worked out some original ideas, and showed them to him on his return.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Then Mr. Scott said to her, in effect: "We will open a regular advertising department,
         and if you want the job of
         assistant advertising manager you can have it."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>She did want it, and she was really the advertising manager, not the assistant. For
         this she received thirty dollars a week.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In 1901 Miss Martin was offered the position of manager of the Alfred E. Special Advertising
         Agency, at fifty dollars a week; and in the two succeeding years she handled some
         very large advertising deals. One of these was a breakfast food campaign.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In 1903 Miss Martin went to the Sperry &amp; Hutchinson Company as assistant advertising
         manager, and is now manager. She is said to be the best paid woman in advertising
         work. She gets more than ten thousand dollars, though on this subject she herself
         is silent.

   <h4>This Lioness Lives in a Sculptor's Back Yard</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>BECAUSE Felix Gould of Paterson, New Jersey, a Dane of twenty-four and a teacher in
         Public School No. 10, wanted to be a sculptor, and found it difficult to procure living
         wild animal models, he bought a lioness cub from the menagerie in Central Park and
         took it to his home as a pet.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The cub being not much larger than a kitten, young Gould carried it home in his arms,
         and, following instructions, proceeded to bring it up by means of a bottle and two
         quarts of milk a day, to which the baby lioness took very kindly indeed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Every two hours she nestled in his arms and had her bottle, exactly as a baby does,
         and never once in the whole six months of her babyhood did her master fail to be on
         hand at feeding time. Naturally the cub's affections centered on young Gould, who
         always has had intense fondness for wild animals, and understands their natures so
         well that he is absolutely fearless where they are concerned.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>How Queenie Shows Her Affection</h4>
      
      
      <p>WHEN Queenie, as the lioness is called, greets him by rising on her hind legs, putting
         both fore paws about his neck and pulling his head down to he kissed, he takes it
         as a matter of course; and when she rubs her face against his with every demonstration
         of affection, young. Gould returns the embrace, and with a pat on the tawny hide says,
         "Well, Queenie, old girl, we understand each other, don't we?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>And Queenie makes a loving purring sound, for all the world like a great cat, and
         settles in his arms with a huge murmur of perfect content.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The lioness is now nearly a year old, and the nursing bottle has long since been 
         
         
         
      </p>
      <p>
         <div class="inline_figure">
            <div class="p">[illustration]</div>
            
            <span class="head"></span>
            
            <p>
               <em>All the neighbors' children used to play with this lioness; but now that she has been
                  taken off the nursing bottle and put on a flesh diet, parents have ceased to look
                  upon her with favor. Five-year-old Rhoda, the niece of Felix Gould, the sculptor who
                  owns her, is now the cub's only playmate
               </em>.
            </p>
            
            
         </div>
      </p>
      <p>
         
         
         
         replaced by a good measure of chopped beef, a long rib bone, and basins of vegetable
         soup, with a daily loaf of bread.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The neighbors objected to her daily rambles about the yard; so the porch in the rear
         of the Gould home was inclosed and fitted with wire screening and glassed sides, in
         order that Queenie might look out on the back yard and watch the children at play.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>She considers children her legitimate playmates, and when not permitted to roam freely
         among them shows her displeasure by roars the size of a full grown lion's, although
         she weighs hardly eighty pounds.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>She Used to Play with the Children</h4>
      
      <p>WHEN she was a cub, with the freedom of the house and yard, sitting at table with
         the rest of the family, curling up in all the chairs, and getting underfoot in all
         sorts of unexpected places, the neighbors' children loved to sprawl on the ground
         with her, scratch her back, pull her ears, and roll over and over in paroxysms of
         laughter when she sprang first at one, then at another, enjoying the sport as much
         as they. Young Gould's arms and hands show the scars of many bites given when she
         lunged at him in playful mood. But, as she grew larger and older, devoted fathers
         and anxious mothers pulled their offspring away from the back yard one by one, until
         only little Rhoda—five years old, and a niece of the Gould family—was allowed to play
         with or go near the lioness at all.
      </p>
      
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Queenie Likes Automobiling</h4>
      
      <p>THE two are great friends. Rhoda is not at all afraid to pull open Queenie's jaws
         to display the great dangerous molars inside, or to let the animal embrace her, but
         lavishes caresses upon her and orders her about. She is often present at meal-time;
         but when the lioness is feeding no one, not even her master, can touch her without
         arousing a savage snarl. She lives in luxury—a straw bed, feeding bowls and drinking
         vessels, a medicine shelf containing sulphur and phosphate, which all wild animals
         in captivity need, and various other articles. She "gobbles" sadly at meals; but always
         has her face wiped with her own special napkin, and seems to miss it if the ceremony
         is not promptly performed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Her favorite diversion is an automobile ride, and there isn't a horn made whose honk
         can startle her. As she is now worth about six times what her owner paid for her,
         she is a valuable animal, and her outings are taken only at night, that she may be
         well guarded. She is a Barbary lioness, said to be one of the most beautiful of her
         kind.

      <p>THE men who work for the government at Washington seem able to be away from their

         three women away for any long period, it is hard to imagine what calamities might
         not happen. For one of them tells Washington when to wear its dress suit and what
         fork to use first at the table; and one is the "great mother" to all the Indian tribes;
         and the third is Washington's official tea-taster.

      <p>THESE are some of the hundreds of puzzling questions that used to drive the wives
         of new senators and congressmen almost to distraction. For the etiquette of official
         Washington has been fixed since the days of Thomas Jefferson, and woe to the unfortunate
         woman whose ignorance led her to transgress the law. Many of them did transgress in
         former days, and suffered bitterly for it. But that was before Mrs. Peter R. Labouisse
         established her Bureau of Social Assistance. Now, no hostess or guest, no matter how
         inexperienced, need go astray. For a telephone message to Mrs. Labouisse, or a letter
         of inquiry, will bring directions for any function, all written in words of one syllable,
         and as easy to follow as a menu-card. That is Mrs. Labouisse's job—keeping the social
         elect from eating ice cream with a fork.

         Indian lineage has a very different clientele. Miss Marie L. Baldwin's clients still
         eat with their fingers, as their ancestors did. You will find her in the Indian Bureau.
         She is the official conscience of the government in its dealings with the Indians.
         It is Miss Baldwin's job to see that their interests are protected, that no deals
         are put through to their disadvantage, and that when Indian affairs are discussed
         there is some one on hand to see that the red men on the far-away plains get what
         is coming to them.

      <p>ciently a diplomat to convert to his own uses the feelings of another. "For myself,"
         he went on, "the recovery of the necklace without the cross will not serve. Were I
         free to choose, gladly would I sacrifice myself to preserve the innocent conscience
         of your ward; but alas, I am not free! On the recovery of the Cross of Kemesvar is
         depending my future life and the happiness of one dearer than my life. Until I restore
         it to Prince Vasilief I must serve here, an exile from my home and all most dear dear
         to me. In your ward lies now my one hope of finding the cross. You will therefore
         pardon me if I insist."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I'm sorry, Count Szemere, but my mind is made up. She shall not be shown the necklace,
         nor shall she be questioned about it."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>AN ominous light appeared in the Rumanian's eyes; but his voice when he replied showed
         no trace of annoyance.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I repeat that I respect your sentiment, my dear Mr. Senior; but I fear you do not
         comprehend fully of this matter. When you met this lady she was wearing a necklace
         that did not belong to her, and she was, it appears, running away with it. Her coat,
         you have told me, was of black with a sable collar. Very well. In the dead hand of
         Prince Lascar there was found a piece of sable. Have you forgotten that, my dear Mr.
         Senior? Maybe it was that the hand that took the cross from the necklace was also
         the hand that killed the Prince. Who knows? Who—but the lady?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Hugh gave back the narrowed glance without flinching. "You're wasting your time,"
         he said shortly. "I know as well
         you do that the last thing you are looking for in this affair is publicity. You don't
         want it any more than you wanted it when you so carefully excluded all mention of
         the Prince and his necklace from that murder trial."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"You deceive yourself!" exclaimed the Count, and for the first time his voice broke
         from his control. "No man, no woman, shall be spared but that the cross is found.
         I have spoken! Terrible things may come, who knows?—if no other way is found!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Threats won't help you, Count Szemere. This is New York, not Bukharest. The necklace
         will be returned to you when your government has identified it. Beyond that I can
         not help you. This is my last word!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>SZEMERE whitened with rage, and his body shook as in a chill. He sprang to his feet
         and faced Hugh, who had risen in the signal of dismissal. They measured each other
         silently. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Amarinth had also risen, and now he took a step forward to a position beside Szemere
         and opposing Hugh. "It's not my last word!" he said suddenly.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>His companions turned and looked at him.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"I think Count Szemere has a right to know all she might be able to tell him," he
         said. "And I have a right to know!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Why?" Hugh demanded quietly. "You've made your decision—that's been evident for some
         time. Would anything you could learn now alter it? You have no intention of marrying
         Marie. I don't deny your right to withdraw. But you are pledged to secrecy. I have
         your word of honor—don't forget it."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"And I have yours! You told me that if I married Marie her story would become my property
         to use as I saw fit. Didn't you?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Yes." Into Hugh's face a faint surprise had crept.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"Well, I married her last night."</p>
      
      
      <p>There was a pause.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Amarinth, is that true?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Guy took the marriage certificate from his pocket. Hugh's hand shook as he
         
         
         
         opened and read it. A minute longer he held it, staring at it with unseeing eyes,
         then he gave it back. "What do you wish me to do?" he asked, turning away.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"First show her the necklace."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Where?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"If you will permit a suggestion, Mr. Amarinth," Szemere put in. "I think it would
         be well that she sees it here—quite unprepared—that is, if Mr. Senior does not object?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"As Mr. Amarinth pleases," said Hugh.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"I think that's the best way," Guy answered.</p>
      
      
      <p>Szemere continued eagerly: "With Mr. Senior's consent the necklace can be brought
         here by the Rumanian Consul. All may arrange itself by telephone quickly."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Why not let one of Lozier's men bring it?" Hugh asked.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"The Consul's permission is now necessary."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Then let him come with Lozier's man. "You can 'phone him, and I'll call Lozier. There's
         a telephone in the library."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>THE sending up of the necklace was soon arranged for, then the three men sat down
         to wait. No one attempted conversation. After a few minutes of silence Hugh rang for
         the afternoon papers, and each made an effort or a pretense at reading. In about twenty
         minutes the Consul and his escort arrived, and were shown into the library. A box
         containing the necklace was then delivered, and the bearers retired to wait in the
         drawing-room.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When the three were alone Hugh looked at Amarinth. "What are your orders?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Szemere replied: "We must surprise her. Look! We shall place it so—just under the
         lamp." He opened the box and set it in the position indicated. On its background of
         satin and with the strong light full upon it, it blazed. "Now I turn the light out.
         So! When she enters you will ask her to sit there—just by the lamp."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Hugh nodded.</p>
      
      
      <p>"For me, I am placed here. Suddenly I advance and turn up the light. So!"</p> 
      
      
      <p>Again the gems sprang to life, and he looked up for Amarinth's approval.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"That's all right."</p>
      
      
      <p>Hugh had been standing watching, with lips tightly pressed together, his face drawn
         and pale. Now at Guy's words he crossed to a bell and rang.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Graham appeared.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"Bring the tea, please, and—ask Miss Marie if she will join us."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Yes, sir."</p>
      
      
      <p>The man departed, and Szemere, who at the servant's arrival had changed his position
         so as to screen the jewels from view, now resumed the seat he had chosen and again
         lowered the lamp.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>The butler returned with the tea tray, and carried it to the table on which he had
         placed its predecessor. He struck a 
         match and lit the spririt lamp.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The ears of the three men were strained toward the hall.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Shall I make the tea, sir?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Hugh looked up with a slight start. "No; Miss Marie will do it."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Miss Marie has gone out, sir."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Gone out! Are you sure?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"Yes, sir. I chanced to be in the hall when she left, sir."</p>
      
      
      <p>"When was it?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"About half an hour since, sir."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Then she may have returned. She's probably with Mrs. Thorley."</p>
      
      
      <p>"I've just inquired; she's not in the house, sir."</p>
      
      
      <p>"She left no message?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"No, sir. Mrs. Thorley was asleep, and the maids didn't know as how she was out. Shall
         I make the tea, sir?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"No. That's all."</p>
      
      
      <p>The instant the door closed on the man Count Szemere rose excitedly. "She has run
         away! She knew me and was
         
         
         
         afraid! She has seen her danger better than you, Mr. Senior. Ah, pardon, but I can
         no longer pretend to believe your story of the lost memory! It is too bizarre—that!
         She is afraid and runs away, that simply. How else will you explain?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I can't explain," Hugh answered. "I can only assure you that I have acted in good
         faith with you both. I had no idea of this marriage. She told me nothing."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I had forbidden her to tell you," Amarinth said.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Exactly. And I don't know what other orders you may have given her. I don't know
         where she has gone nor why. I know nothing. The affair, Count Szemere, now rests between
         you and Mr. Amarinth."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"It is not to waste time here!" exclaimed the Count, dragging on his overcoat. "The
         necklace—it must go back at once!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Hugh acquiesced silently, and with the box of jewels he led the way to the drawing-room,
         where the Rumanian Consul and his companion waited. Their cab stood at the curb, and
         they presently departed in it with the necklace.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Szemere bowed formally. "I have warned you how far my government will advance to recover
         the necklace and the cross. I now communicate with my chief at Washington for authority
         to proceed. If I have not satisfactory news from you in the meantime, the affair will
         be placed in the hands of the police. My hotel is the Knickerbocker. Good afternoon."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Good afternoon," said Hugh.</p>
      
      
      <p>Szemere strode to the door.</p>
      
      
      <p>AMARINTH moved to follow; but a gesture from Hugh halted him. In silence they waited
         until they had heard the outer door open and close again.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Have you no idea where she has gone?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Amarinth shook his head.</p>
      
      
      <p>"This marriage. When was it and where?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"Last night. We left the ball, were married, and went right back. It was my fault,
         I suppose: I persuaded her," he admitted grudgingly. "Afterward she told me there
         was something she had kept from me—something you would tell me. Well, I thought if
         you knew we were already married you might keep something back, and I wanted the truth."
         He laughed harshly. "Well, I'm getting it, I guess!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Then you believe—all this?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Guy made a sound of impatience. "Oh, what's the good of talking about that? If we
         are to keep the police off the case, we shall have to do something."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"What?"</p>
      
      
      <p>Guy hesitated, his eyes leveled suspiciously on Hugh. "I'll tell you later," he said,
         crossing to the door.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I don't think you need worry about Szemere's going to the police. That was only a
         bluff."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I'm not so sure! Oh, it's easy for you to take the thing calmly—she's not your wife!
         Why did she go away if it wasn't to avoid meeting that man again?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Why should she have wanted to avoid him? She didn't recognize him."</p>
      
      
      <p>"I'm not so sure of that!"</p>
      
      
      <p>"I see! Then you agree with him that it isn't a case of loss of memory but simply
         pretense?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"My God! I don't know what to believe!" Guy cried, with a pull at the door.</p>
      
      
      <p>"Perhaps, like Szemere, you think I warned her of his coming?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"No, I think you've been square with me. I realize that you needn't have told me anything
         about her. But there's one thing I know. She had seen that man before she met him
         in the library."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Seen him? Where?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"She was standing at an upstairs window when we got out of the cab. I happened to
         look up, and when she saw me looking she jerked her head away."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>THE sound of the outer door closing struck on Hugh's ear, then the youth's quick tread
         on the sidewalk. Guy had waited for no answer to his final disclosure, and Hugh, indeed,
         had had none
         
         
         
         ready. He stared about the big, empty room dazedly.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>So she had seen Szemere arrive, had known when she entered the library that he was
         there! He recalled how he had stepped between them to shield her from the Count's
         sight, and with the memory came the vision of her face at that moment. Instantly all
         doubt of her vanished. Suspicion could not exist in his mind side by side with her
         image. She had gone away, why or where he did not know; but he knew that she would
         come back.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He paced the floor, his nails digging into his palms. His aunt was right: he had been
         a fool to stand aside for other men. What had come of it but misery for her and all
         of them? He had meant only her happiness, and had sacrificed himself that she might
         find it in her own way. And that way had brought her to this, that she was the wife
         of a cad, a hound, who was ready to believe her all that was despicable and vile.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Married! Amarinth's wife! And not a word, not a glance, had passed between them. He
         was sure of it; for he had watched in wretched jealousy to see what she would have
         for the man she loved.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A cry of rage broke from him. He was seized by the primitive instinct to kill the
         thing that thwarted him. Back and forth across the room he paced, and it was long
         before his mind was clear enough for rational thought. But reason could not help him.
         It told him only that he could do nothing. Amarinth was master now.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>But yes, there was something he could do. The knife! If Szemere should carry out his
         threat and go to the police—
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He hurried to his study, and unlocking the drawer from which the night before he had
         taken the necklace he took out the box in which lay the dirk with the bone handle.
         No one had ever known of it except Dr. Vining, and he had thought it wiser not to
         mention the matter to Mrs. Thorley for fear of alarming her. But it was this knife,
         carried in her bodice, that had caused the wound in the girl's breast, and so led
         to his discovery of the necklace.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>To whatever lengths Szemere might go, the fur-trimmed coat could never be produced;
         for it had been destroyed in a storage-house fire in London with many of Mrs. Thorley's
         belongings. But the knife!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Maybe it was that the hand that took the cross from the necklace was the hand that
         killed the Prince."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Szemere's words rang in his ears. He must get rid of the knife. If it were found,
         Szemere might recognize it. He stared down at it as it lay in his hand. It could not
         be destroyed: he must hide it. He glanced about the room, then passed into the library,
         seeking a hiding place. There he at last decided on a window box from which a thick
         growth of ivy climbed a low trellis. The blade pierced its way through the soil to
         the bottom of the box, and he pushed the handle well under the surface. Then he smoothed
         the broken earth above it and readjusted the displaced creepers.

      <h4>CHAPTER XVI</h4>
      
      <p>GAVOCK looked at his watch and returned it to his pocket with a puzzled lift of the
         brows. It was half-past five, and Miss Lowther had not come back. He had replaced
         in the envelop awaiting her the money taken out for Andrus, and was anxious to return
         her jeweled cross. The possession of this irked him. Her ignorance of its value, her
         aversion to offering it at a pawnshop, her insistence upon his holding it as collateral,—all
         things that had seemed natural enough as she explained them,—now fairly bristled with
         suspiciousness. He was willing to make her a loan or a gift, whichever she preferred
         to call it; but he wanted nothing to do with that very remarkable piece of jewelry.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The telephone rang; but to his disappointment it was not Miss Lowther who was announced.
         It was Amarinth, and Gavock directed that he be sent up.

      <p>He tucked the cross away again in his pocket, and after a brief deliberation car-

         ried the portrait of Alix Floria into his bedroom. He had no doubt as to the purpose of
         Guy's visit, and was surprised that it had not been made sooner. Fortunately he was
         now in a position to speak frankly of the matter. Miss Dupont could not be the dancer
         Alix Floria, whoever she might be. Still, her resemblance to the portrait was so striking
         that it could only disturb Guy to see it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>AMARINTH wasted little time in greetings. "I've come to ask you some questions, Mr.
         Gavock. You mistook Miss Dupont for somebody yesterday, and last night you said it
         was for some one who is dead. Is that true?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"My dear boy!"</p>
      
      
      <p>"How can you wonder at my doubting you?" Guy exclaimed. "After what you said about
         lying to shield a woman you could hardly expect me not to."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"You're right," Gavock admitted. "But it happens that Miss Dupont does not require
         shielding; so I am free to indulge in the luxury of telling the truth. I mistook her
         for a girl named Alix Floria, who was murdered in Paris seven years ago."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"You are sure of it—that she was murdered, I mean?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"Why, her body was found in her room!"</p>
      
      
      <p>Gavock tossed this off with the air of one silencing all doubts, and his tone almost
         stung Amarinth into voicing the doubt he knew existed; but he caught his words back
         in time. He affected relief. "Oh, so there's no doubt about her being dead!" he said.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Of course not!" Gavock replied.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"Who was she, anyway?" Guy asked, feigning simple curiosity.</p>
      
      
      <p>Gavock told the story of Alix Floria, being careful, however, to drop no hint of the
         doubt that had arisen as to the identity of the dead body. Andrus had convinced him
         that there was no real doubt of it. The fact of the marriage with Andrus he also omitted,
         feeling that to tell that would be to betray a confidence. Little did he dream as
         he talked that his narrative struck familiarly on his listener's ear, that behind
         his fixed stare Amarinth was saying to himself:
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"It's all true then, all that Szemere said!"</p>
      
      
      <p>It was to find that out that he had come, and the certainty only increased his fear
         of the publicity Szemere had threatened. What was to be done now? What could be done?
         At the close of the story he rose with some non-committal word of comment as if to
         go, but paused irresolute. Where should he go?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Suddenly the memory of some words of Gavock's on the preceding night flashed into
         his mind. He turned back uncer-
         
         
         
         tainly. He was reluctant to make a confidant of anyone, yet felt the need of counsel. And
         Gavock had been his father's friend.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Mr. Gavock, do you remember what you said to me last night—about coming to you if
         I ever wanted help? You knew then, didn't you?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Knew? Knew what?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"That Miss Dupont is Alix Floria."</p>
      
      
      <p>"My dear Guy!"</p>
      
      
      <p>"You recognized her in her photograph?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"But I was mistaken—"</p>
      
      
      <p>"No, you were right; she is Alix Floria. Listen!"</p>
      
      
      <p>Quickly Amarinth told the story of the girl as he had heard it from Hugh Senior and
         from Count Szemere, omitting only the fact of her disappearance.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I'VE asked her to marry me," he said at last, "and this is what I have to face. If
         this Rumanian goes to the police, it will be in all the papers."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I fancy that threat was mere bluff," Gavock answered. "Publicity would be against
         all his racial traditions."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"If it isn't bluff, do you think he could be stopped by going to Washington? He has
         wired the Rumanian Minister for authority to act in the affair. Would it be possible
         to get at the Rumanian Minister?"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Oh, I hardly think that will be necessary."</p>
      
      
      <p>"But he threatens to go to the police—to accuse Miss Dupont, not only of stealing
         the necklace, but of killing the Prince!" Guy urged excitedly.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Gavock laughed. "Never! He will never be permitted to drag the indiscretions of any
         prince, dead or alive, into the newspapers. It isn't the policy of monarchial governments
         to publish the moral weaknesses of their aristocracy. The affair is most unfortunate,
         and you have my deepest sympathy; but I feel sure there is no danger of the matter
         becoming known to the public. And for yourself you have only to withdraw your offer
         of marriage—"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I may as well tell you the truth. We're already married!" Guy blurted out, and told
         the story of his marriage.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Gavock deliberated anxiously with himself. The affair might turn out to be far more
         serious than he had supposed for his young friend. If Andrus was mistaken and this
         girl was Alix Floria, then she was Andrus' wife! Well, that would let Guy out. But
         he must say nothing as yet. He must see Andrus. And where was Andrus? Somewhere in
         a hospital, ill, dying perhaps.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Of course I can get an annulment,"
         
         
         
         Guy muttered; "but it's a beastly hole for a man to be in."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Gavock studied the frowning face. "You love her, of course?" he murmured.</p> 
      
      
      <p>"I did."</p>
      
      
      <p>"Did! When? Yesterday? Then you do to-day, and will to-morrow and many days after.
         Love isn't killed in an hour, don't think it!" A wave of feeling crossed his face,
         and he laid his hand on the young man's arm. "Don't be in a hurry. Nothing has been
         proved. Wait!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"There isn't a chance that she isn't that dancer, Mr. Gavock, and the best I can hope
         for is to keep the story from getting out. Do you think you could do anything at Washington?
         You said last night that you knew the French Ambassador."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I could reach the Rumanian Minister through him, and I shall be glad to do anything
         I can for you. But I don't believe Szemere will dare to move openly—"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"He's hot after that cross. He'll go to any lengths to find it."</p>
      
      
      <p>"What cross?"</p>
      
      
      <p>"The missing pendant. It's a Greek cross that the Patriarch of Constantinople gave
         to a Prince Xico who was an Archbishop—at least, so Szemere says. He says it is as
         valuable as the rest of the necklace, and the stones in that are so big it looks like
         stage junk."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Did he describe it?" Far back in Gavock's head an idea had stirred, fantastic, hardly
         defined, incredible.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"I don't remember; but it is probably like the necklace, barbaric looking, with emeralds,
         rubies, and diamonds, enameled on the under side. But I must go. I must find out what
         Mr. Senior has done."
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"You'll let me know if I can do anything at Washington? I'm sure, however, that you
         need not worry about Szemere. And don't make a mistake about the other. Wait until
         you're sure. Don't throw away the gift of the gods, dear boy!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Guy turned toward the door, his jaw set.</p>
      
      
      <p>"That's what I did, Guy, twenty years ago, and I've paid for it with twenty years
         of loneliness. Wait, dear boy, wait!"
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"You're very kind," said Guy, flushing. "Good night."</p>
      
      
      <p>GAVOCK sighed as the door closed. It was a sigh compounded of many kinds of regret—regret
         for youth's pride and reckless obstinacy, for man's inhumanity to woman, for his own
         lonely, wasted years. And then he sighed again for the futility of regret, for the
         uselessness of sighing.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He took the cross from his pocket and unwrapped the handkerchief carefully folded
         about it. His hands were slightly nervous. He was telling himself that
         
         
         
         there must be many Greek crosses set in diamonds and emeralds and rubies and backed
         by enameling, that such a coincidence was too wild and absurd to be considered calmly.
         And yet—
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He looked at the ornament in his hand. It might well have been a gift from the Patriarch
         of Constantinople to a princely Archbishop. Incredible as that idea appeared, it was
         less incongruous than Miss Lowther's story. That, he was convinced, was pure fabrication.
         At any rate, he meant to be sure. The thing had come into his hands by what secret
         road he could not guess; but it should not go out of his hands until he was satisfied
         that it was not the pendant sought by this Rumanian.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>But what would be the quickest, wisest course to follow to that end? Should he go
         to Guy or Hugh Senior? Neither of them could identify it. Why not go straight to Szemere?
         One glance from him would perhaps settle the matter. Then there was Andrus; he too
         had seen the cross, no doubt. It must have been attached to the necklace when he painted
         it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A STARTLING idea flashed into Gavock's mind. He wheeled and hurried to his bedroom.
         Taking the portrait of Alix Floria, he returned with it and examined it closely under
         the full light of the char delier. No trace of the painted jewels was visible through
         the coat of flesh tint. Yet now he noticed for the first time that the brushwork in
         the painting of the neck and bosom was not so free and sure-handed as in the other
         parts of the canvas. Perhaps Andrus had done it later with his left hand. In that
         case the work beneath must have well dried.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He hesitated. He was reluctant to have the portrait touched; it was not actually his
         property. And yet the damage could easily be repaired by Andrus himself. Certainly
         if it were feasible it was the simplest way to satisfy his doubts. To show the cross
         to Guy or to Szemere would call for some sort of explanation that he could not offer
         truthfully without involving Miss Lowther. And after all the chance that it was the
         missing pendant from the necklace was a slight one. Far better on all counts to satisfy
         himself without taking any one into his confidence.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>He looked at his watch. It was after six. The picture shops would be closed by now;
         but work does not always stop in a shop because the front door has been locked. If
         he let the matter go till morning, he might have cause to regret the delay. He decided
         to act at once, and opening the telephone book he hunted out the name of an art dealer
         whom he knew.

   <h4>What to Do When You're Lost in the Woods</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>TO "get lost" is the easiest thing in the world for lots of people if they stray away
         from cement sidewalks and
         streets that run between rows of houses. Plenty of people confess that they "get turned
         around" even in cities, and comparatively few casual visitors to the wilderness can
         keep any idea of directions at all.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Of course, most people who go on regular trips to the wilds each year learn the knack
         of directions; but even these in thick timber or rough country will frequently get
         completely bewildered.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>All this comes from living in civilization, where one does not have to depend on positive
         directions.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>All woodsmen, range riders, mountain men, Indians, and other outdoor people develop
         the sense of direction to such an extent that they unconsciously note every change
         in direction as they travel. They always know just where north is without even stopping
         to think about it, and will turn in their tracks and go back to their starting point
         as straight as a bee, regardless of turns and twists.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>For the novice who can not do this and thus gets "lost" there are two things to bear
         in mind, especially if he gets lost in a sparsely settled country or in an uninhabited
         wilderness.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The first is, don't "get rattled" or frightened and go plunging off in the direction
         you think camp is; for nine times out of ten you will go away instead of toward it.
         Just keep cool, and don't get into a panic; for you can pull yourself out of your
         difficulty if you keep cool and think.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Follow the Water Courses</h4>
      
      <p>IN any given country the streams flow in a given general direction, and thus all the
         larger streams run more or less the same way. And almost any one can remember which
         way the water courses he has passed or crossed were flowing; so this alone will act
         as a guide to general directions back the way you came, and prevent traveling in a
         circle.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>All men who are lost, and nearly all wild animals, travel, broadly speaking, in a
         wide circle to the left all the time, and if one retraces this broad circle to the
         right it will bring him somewhere near his starting point, time and speed of travel
         being the same, in about the same time it took him to come from his starting point.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The surest way for the novice, however, is to forget that he is lost, and try his
         best to find some human habitation by following the first running water he comes to.
         Of course he should camp the best he knows how, and get what shelter and sleep he
         can at night, and never in any circumstances attempt to travel the wilderness in the
         dark; for only an expert can do that, and even he is liable to accidental falls or
         hurts in the dark.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The novice should travel in daylight only, and always travel down stream, following
         the first flowing water course he finds, and not leave it. Just travel "with the water"
         and keep going, and it will bring you to some human habitation sooner or later, because
         new settlers in a wild country always travel up the streams and stick to water as
         a necessity. Therefore the outlying settlements are almost always close to a running
         stream.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Live on Fishes and Edible Plants</h4>
      
      
      <p>ANIMALS, birds, and fishes live in or along the streams, just as edible plants do;
         so one can always find some way to get enough grub to go on. If one has gun and fishing
         tackle, he is fixed if he follows the streams. So carry a few hooks and lines in your
         pockets when you go to the wilderness, and use them if you get lost.

   <p>NO man has done so much to scour the United States of germs and filth as Dr. Rupert
      Blue, the Surgeon-General of the United States Public Health Service. Thanks to him,
      the common drinking cup and roller towel have about disappeared. In 1907 he stamped
      out the bubonic plague in San Francisco, even clearing out all infected rats and squirrels.
      At the time of the Jamestown Exposition a transport of West Point cadets; planned
      to camp there, but they could find no sanitary spot. Such a report would have hurt
      the Exposition badly, and Dr. Blue's aid was instantly sought. The doctor built the
      necessary drainage almost in a night. In 1911 President Taft summoned him from Hawaii,
      where he was fighting the yellow fever, to make him surgeon-general; and since then
      his life has been restricted to Washington, though he hopes sometime to lead an exploring
      party up the Amazon River to study insect life. Moreover, to protect the health of
      the United States, he must know health conditions not only in the United States, and
      in Cuba and Central America, but throughout the whole world. Br. Blue has studied
      extensively abroad, specializing in tropical medicine. He is the youngest man who
      has ever held this post.

   <h4>Nature Fakers</h4>
   
   
   <p>THESE are not nature fakers. Nature fakers are human beings. Natural fakers are animals
      that know how to deceive an enemy by pretending to be something they are not.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Two of the most interesting of these are the so-called "walking-stick" and the Kallima
      butterfly of India. As long as it is not alarmed the walking-stick is a slender brown
      insect, mounted on three sets of slender brown legs. But as soon as danger approaches
      the walking-stick draws in its legs, disposes itself on a brown twig, and for all
      practical purposes, as far as its enemy is concerned, becomes part of the twig.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As for the Kallima butterfly, it makes a special point of parading about in full sight,
      even hanging suspended in midair, its beautiful wings widely stretched to show their
      glorious markings. But at the first hint of danger it makes for the nearest bush,
      chooses a twig, and folds back the pointed ends of its wings on the branch to which
      the twig is attached. In this position, and helped by the brown patches

   <h4>Club Life for Babies</h4>
   
   
   <p>AND now babies have their club!</p>
   
   
   <p>After all, it's a reasonable enough proposition. Grown-ups belong to clubs in order
      to keep themselves from being bored. Well, who, on the whole, has a more boring time
      than Friend Baby? Just one weary round of sleeping and eating and waiting around for
      something interesting to happen!
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It's far otherwise at the first and only Babies' Club, which is to be found, thanks
      to Mrs. Waldorf Astor, at Stepney Green, just outside London. Something doing here
      all the time.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The members are left at the club early in the morning by their mothers on their way
      to work, and are called for on their way home. Though they are young,—three is the
      age limit,—club babies find all sorts of diverting occupations open to them.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When meal-time approaches, at a signal on the piano they all run off to the scullery,
      and reappear carrying tablecloths, stacks of plates, and basins. In a few minutes
      they have the tables laid.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>When dinner is ready, a little boy or girl, as the case may be, sits at the head of
      the table and serves the food, in a most dignified manner, to the other children.
      Thus every meal is a delightful tea party.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>After dinner the children draw out little mattreses on which they lie down and take
      as nap. Then they adjourn to the playground on the roof, where they amuse themselves
      until it is time to go home.

   <h4>Aging Forty Years in Three Days</h4>
   
   
   <div class="inline_figure">
      <div class="p">[illustration]</div>
      
      <span class="head"></span>
      
      <p></p>
       
      
   </div>
   
   
   <p>NOT long ago James Morrison was called upon to stage forty years within the unwinding
      of a one-reel photo-drama. He was first to appear as a youth of twenty-five, then
      as a man of forty-five, and finally as the same man twenty years later.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Instinctively Mr. Morrison reached for the family album. Yes; as he had thought, the
      young men of two generations ago parted their hair on the right side, whereas to-day
      the left side is in favor. Now for the face.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Says the actor:</p>
   
   
   <p>"I had to make the wasting of years visible to the audience. There is a great difference
      in the amount of flesh on the face between twenty-five and sixty-five. I decided to
      add a little flesh in the youthful scene by building up from the inside of the cheeks
      with paraffin. When I removed this and appeared as my normal self I got about the
      right contour for the face of forty-five.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"To make my face thinner than it really is was a problem of the proper handling of
      flesh-paints. The shadows under the cheek-bones, under the lower lip, and under the
      eyes, together with the high-light on the cheekbones and the bridge of the nose, gave
      me this effect. You see, what I had to find out was just how 
      <em>I</em> would look when 
      <em>I</em> got old. I had to study my own features, and learn where on my own face the lights
      and shadows will eventually come, if I live, that will make me old in appearance and
      in reality. I know that when I get to be forty-five I shall comb my hair carefully
      over a little bald spot, and wear a youthful sort of mustache. We all do it.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Then I had to make up my hands. They were lightened with talcum powder in the first
      scene, to prevent the camera shadows, which always make one's hands seem older. I
      left them au naturel in the forty-five-year-old scene. But in the last one I accentuated
      the veins and added the shadows that belong to an old man's hands. F. Hopkinson Smith's
      'Colonel Carter' stories, together with his exquisite pictures of that delightful
      old character, helped me immensely in this regard.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Here is another point, and a very important one. All the gray wigs and flesh-paints
      in the world will not make a young man appear old before the sharp eye of the camera
      if he stands up before this camera conscious only of his twenty or thirty years. In
      my old-age characters I am, for the time being, an old, old man, carrying the mental
      as well as the physical burden of years. I imagine my pulse to be slower, my muscles
      to be atrophied, my joints to be stiff.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"I sent a photograph of myself in the first of these scenes to a dear old lady who
      was a schoolmate of my father's.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"'Now, Jimmie,' she writes me, 'you never saw your father when he was as young as
      that, but I have. I have seen him hundreds of times; and so you can't come any of
      your jokes on me. I know that is a picture of your father.'
   </p>
   
   
   <p>"Did any one ever have a better compliment for his 'make-up' ability than this?"</p>
   
   
   
   <div class="footnotes"> </div>
   
   
   
   <h4>Food that Grows Wild</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>NINETY-NINE out of every hundred things that grow wild we regard as "weeds," and because
         that term is applied to them we never for a moment think that they maybe edible, may
         furnish good and nourishing food.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Nearly everything in the line of food may be dug out of the earth, picked from roadside
         shrubs and bushes, or boiled out of the fruits of trees. Practically anywhere one
         may happen to be, from Nova Scotia, to Florida, and from the Atlantic to the Pacific,
         if he knows the way of doing it he may secure all sorts of foods from wild vegetation.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Cattail Soup</h4>
      
      
      <p>EXCELLENT soup may be made by boiling the soft ends of cattails. It tastes like vegetable
         soup, with a bit of snappy, pungent flavor. The chopped root ends of cattails, mixed
         with watercress, with the juice of more watercress squeezed over it, makes a delicious
         salad. Other edibles may be properly classed as substitutes for bread, meat, flour,
         beans, spinach, beer, cider, vinegar, peas, starch, pickles, coffee, hot cakes, olive
         oil, etc.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"Small beer" can be made from the sap of the black birch, from the twigs of black
         and red spruce, and from the pulp of honey-locust pods, the fruit of the persimmon,
         and the root of sassafras. Cider and vinegar can be readily made from crab-apples
         and a few species of berries.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>For spinach, and a substitute that is equally as good if not better, there is chickweed,
         found in waste places, fields, and meadows from Nova Scotia to Minnesota, and as far
         south as Kentucky.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A good substitute for flour can be made from the common wild yellow lily, which is
         found almost anywhere that chick-weed grows, and even as far south as Georgia and
         Alabama. This lily has a large, mealy bulb which, when green, looks and tastes very
         much like raw corn on the ear. The Indians and early settlers used it in place of
         flour as a thickening for soup and other dishes.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In their first early hardships the Pilgrims lived to a great extent on the so-called
         groundnut, or Indian potato. This is a wild bean growth that is prevalent anywhere
         from Canada to Florida, and as far west as Missouri.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Dandelion Coffee and Sunflower Hot Cakes</h4>
      
      
      <p>THE flower of the ordinary marigold may be pickled. It is readily obtainable in marsh
         and meadow lands in almost any of the Eastern, Southern, and Middle Western States.
         Coffee substitutes can be obtained from any number of different fruits; vegetables,
         nuts, and leaves. Perhaps the most satisfying relative of the caffeine bean is the
         seed of rye and ground okra. Less agreeable substitutes may be made of parched meal,
         dried sweet potatoes, wheat, cottonseed, dandelion seed, and a host of others.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Hot cakes and a kind of olive oil can be produced from the ordinary sunflower. The
         seeds of this plant were one of the most popular forms of food for the Indians. When
         they are parched and ground they make a very good flour, which can
         be made into thin cakes and baked in hot ashes. The oil pressed from sunflower seeds
         makes a good substitute for olive oil.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>No Need to Starve in the Woods</h4>
      
      
      <p>STARCH—and the real thing too—may be derived from one of the most poisonous of wild
         plants by a process of heating and drying. The so-called crowfoot, which is abundant
         all along the Atlantic seaboard and even as far west as Missouri, though giving off
         a juice that if taken internally would cause a fatal inflammation, can be made edible
         by being boiled and baked. After being cleansed and pounded, and the pulp soaked in
         a considerable quantity of water, a white powder is deposited, which when washed and
         dried is real starch.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If one should ever get lost in the woods, should become hungry and desperate, he would
         have right at hand any number of different kinds of food to eat. All one has to do
         is to learn the use of the wild weeds, the coarse grasses, and the unsavory-looking
         fruits growing in rank luxuriance in every locality where brush and scrub are plentiful.
         If one only knew it, Nature has more remedies for all the ills that human flesh is
         heir to than the products of man's genius, multiplied a millionfold.

   <h4>Cattle Guard Made of Cactus</h4>
   
   
   <p>AN ingenious section foreman on an Arizona railroad conceived the idea of using the
      cactus plant as a cattleguard at railroad crossings. The first one, which he built
      and installed himself, proved so successful that the company decided to use it exclusively.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>The device is simple enough, consisting of a frame of two-by-six-inch timber placed
      on edge and fitted between the tracks. In the bottom of this structure is placed a
      few inches of sand and gray in which the cactus is planted.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>As the cactus grows in abundance along the road's right of way, this form of goad,
      is the cheapest that could be constructed. That it is also the most efficient is proved
      by the fact that in the first six months not a single animal attempted to cross or
      even to investigate it.

   <h4>The World's Champion of Cowdom</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>ALL hail the championess of all cowdom, Mrs. Finderne Holingen Fayne! She is only
         three years old; but she has shown herself the 100 per cent. efficiency that cow breeders
         have been trying to produce since science took a hand in cattle raising.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Here is what she did that entitled her to the world's championship. During her year's
         test, just closed, she gave 24,612 pounds of milk, 1,395 pounds of butter, 1,115 pounds
         of fat.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Seventeen Times Her Weight in Milk</h4>
      
      
      <p>AS a pint of milk weighs a pound, it will be seen that Mrs. Fayne's annual production
         in quarts was 12,306, or enough to feed twenty-five babies for a year. Mrs. Fayne
         weighs 1,450 pounds; so that she gave seventeen times her own weight in milk in a
         year, and nearly her weight in butter.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In return for all this wonderful milk and butter production all that Mrs. Fayne has
         asked from her caretaker is currying and washing twice a day, and regular feeding.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Possibly the most surprising thing connected with this great performance of Mrs. Fayne's
         is that the cow has grown under the severe strain to which she has been subjected
         for the whole year and has gained in weight something like 200 pounds.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Never once did she miss a meal. A large box stall was allotted to her, in which she
         had liberty to move about at will. During the summer months she was turned out in
         a small lot to graze.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Mrs. Fayne, whose register number is 144,551, is owned and was bred by Bernhard Meyer
         of Finderne Farms at Somerville, New Jersey. She comes of aristocratic lineage, as
         her father was King Hendvereld Aggie, who cost $2,000. In her prime her mother, whose
         name was Mutual Hendvereld Holingen Fayne, was a world champion, also bred by Mr.
         Meyer at the Finderne Farms.

   <p>FIFTEEN years ago a man named Ricker owned—at low tide—two and a half acres of mud
      flats in the East River, opposite 90th street, New York. At high tide his property
      wasn't visible except for one small knob of mud. Ricker gladly sold it to the city
      to escape even the small taxation.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>To-day those two and a half acres of mud flats at low water have been transformed
      into a great island of more than 250 acres, high above high water. It has docks, a
      cable road for hauling ashes, and already work is under way to remove all the institutions
      on Blackwell's Island to this island of ashes and make the former island over into
      a park. For Ricker's Island has been built up during the last fifteen years from ashes
      collected in New York, and the island is now worth $3,000,000.

   <h4>The Camera in Medicine</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>THE piercing value of the X ray is at last well understood; but few people realize
         that the ordinary photographer's lens sometimes reports secrets of ill health that
         the physician's eye has missed. It is not yet determined just how far the camera may
         be depended upon to help the diagnostician; but the demonstrations up to date are
         of peculiar interest to both the scientist and the layman.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>A Case in Which the Camera Foretold Smallpox</h4>
      
      
      <p>SOME time ago, after making a picture
         of a sailor, the photographer was surprised to find on developing the plate that it
         was in some way defective. A second and even a third sitting did not help. The sailor
         was sent to a skin specialist, who reported no trace of any disease. However, the
         eye of the camera proved its searching power; for three days afterward smallpox developed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Another interesting case of the revealing power of the camera is that of a physician
         who was visiting an intimate friend. Happening to see a life-size, full-face photograph
         of his host, the physician noted unmistakable signs of thickening of the tissues.
         He was startled, for he had never noticed it in his friend. Naturally the revelation
         led to the ultimate cure of the disease.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Dr. Hertoghe of Antwerp, who has made this study particularly his own, has used it
         with excellent results in diagnosing an abnormal thyroid gland. A middle-aged man
         had suffered with extreme nervousness all his life. Photographs of him and his near
         relatives showed that peculiar look around the eyes which defies description, but
         is an infallible sign of the neurotic.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Missing links in personal history, an essential part of diagnosis, are often obtainable
         only through photographs.
      </p>
      
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>An Old Photograph Helped This Diagnosis</h4>
      
      
      <p>ONE puzzling case was recently solved by means of a photograph of the patient taken
         in his babyhood. With the help of a reading-glass, the picture showed the enlarged
         wrists and bow legs of rickets, a disease of which the outward signs had completely
         disappeared. Of course, when the effects of this disease were taken into account the
         diagnosis was made clear.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The great advantage of camera diagnosis is that it catches and retains the exact condition
         of the face and can be studied at leisure; while the living face, with its fleeting
         emotions, is far more baffling.

   <h4>The New Coast Guard</h4>
   
   
   <div class=" ">
      
      <p>THE Life Saving Service hitherto has been a civil institution. It is now in process
         of organization as a military establishment, for use in case of war. Every surfman
         is to have his Krag rifle, and will be regularly enlisted, instead of being hired
         for the season, as heretofore. Each life saving station will be provided with one
         machine gun, and the keeper will hold rank as captain.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Rifle practice, and plenty of it, will be in peace time a part of the routine business
         of every station, in order that the men may become expert sharpshooters. They will
         dig trenches in the sand of the beach, and with machine gun and Krags will defend
         the shore line against attack by landing parties of an imaginary enemy.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Immediately upon the outbreak of war the service (now renamed the Coast Guard) will
         automatically become an adjunct of the navy, and as such it will have assigned to
         it the important duty of protecting the naval wireless plants strung all along our
         coasts at intervals of 200 miles. The first thing likely to be attempted by an enemy
         is to capture and disable these outfits for distributing intelligence.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Each wireless plant will be in communication by telephone and telegraph with all the
         life saving stations for a distance of hundreds of miles; and, under the system now
         being organized, an emergency summons will call out from each station a sea-going
         power boat carrying a machine gun and a dozen or more armed men. Thus, within a surprisingly
         short time. a formidable body of defenders will he assembled, trained for the kind
         of fighting that is expected of them. Hastily throwing up intrenchments along the
         beach,—the best fortification in the world is a bank of sand,—they will be able to
         offer dangerous opposition to an invader.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>Every Lighthouse a Signal Station</h4>
      
      <p>EVERY lighthouse from this time forth is to be equipped as a signal station, and similarly
         provided with telephone and telegraph. By the same means of communication the life
         saving stations will be connected together as in a continuous chain all along the
         coasts. No hostile fleet can approach within sight of shore and escape the attention
         of the surfmen and lighthouse keepers, who, in their ordinary business, are trained
         to see everything that floats in range of human vision.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The lighthouses will serve admirably as signal towers. Their equipment, as well as
         that of the life saving stations, will include powerful telescopes and binoculars,
         wigwag flags, navy numeral flags, pistols that shoot fire balls of different colors,
         and acetylene lamps for signaling at night. In time of war a special signal book will
         be furnished by the Navy Department, the international code being of no value, of
         course, where secrecy is desired.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>At short intervals along the beach are telephone boxes, like those used by policemen
         in cities. The surfman out on patrol is never more than a mile or two from such a
         box. Suppose that in time of war he catches sight of a squadron of hostile warships.
         He runs to the nearest box and telephones to the station. The station keeper telephones
         or telegraphs to the naval wireless plant—fifty miles away, perhaps. The wireless
         outfit sends the news to the great long-distance wireless towers at Arlington, across
         the Potomac from Washington. Arlington calls up the Navy Department, which issues
         corresponding orders by wireless to our battle fleet and to the coast forts.
      </p>
      
   </div>
   
   
   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>War-Time Regulations</h4>
      
      <p>IN case of sudden and serious emergency the coast wireless plant would send the news
         direct to the fleet and to the forts and batteries. Even when nothing in particular
         is "doing," in war time a daily telegram will be despatched from each life saving
         station to the headquarters of its own district (inland), using a cipher word to indicate
         that all hands are well and the equipment in good order.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>All such messages in time of war will have right of way over the wires, which when
         necessary will be cleared of every other kind of business. The efficiency of such
         a system was tested in a more or less experimental way during the Spanish War, when
         it proved highly satisfactory. A striking illustration of its merits was afforded
         when the battleship 
         <em>Oregon</em>, after circumnavigating South America, arrived at Jupiter Inlet. Captain Clark sent
         a boat ashore to the life saving station, and inside of ten minutes the Navy Department
         at Washington had his message.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The places most likely to be attacked by a hostile fleet are in the neighborhood of
         harbors, and wherever there is greatest congestion of shipping. Fortunately, it is
         along these parts of the coast that life saving stations are most thickly sprinkled.
         Thus, for example, on the south shore of Long Island there are twenty-nine stations
         within a distance of 150 miles. On the New Jersey coast are forty stations in 110
         miles. Again, south of the entrance to Chesapeake Bay (an open and undefended door
         most inviting to an enemy) there are, between Cape Henry and Cape Hatteras, twenty-two
         stations in a stretch of 75 miles.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There are few life saving stations along the greater part of the Florida and Gulf
         coasts, because in those waters there is comparatively little shipping. But in the
         neighborhood of Galveston there are seven. It will be a surprise to most people, by
         the way, to learn that Galveston is the second most important city in the United States
         in respect to the value of its exports, being outranked in this regard only by New,
         York. It is the port of outlet for the product of the greatest cotton-growing area
         in the world.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>One advantage of the system for war purposes here outlined, and a very important one,
         is that in case of an outbreak of hostilities with a foreign power the trained men
         of the life saving stations will be already on the ground. They
         not have to be assembled elsewhere, transported to the scene of their expected activities,
         and instructed in unfamiliar duties. Their thorough acquaintance with the localities
         in which their work is to be done will in itself be a most valuable help.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Right here too comes in another important point. In time of war the life saving stations
         will furnish pilots for torpedo boats, submarines, and other small naval craft operating
         along the coasts. For such purposes they will possess the requisite acquaintance with
         local waters; they will know every shoal and channel. Our torpedo boats, for instance,
         might find it convenient to hide in river mouths and inlets, in circumstances that
         would make such knowledge vital to their safety.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There are 222 life saving stations along the Atlantic, Gulf, and Pacific coasts of
         the United States, much scattered in some places, thickly sprinkled in others. Taken
         as a whole, they will compose, as organized for signal purposes, a chain of lookouts
         most valuable in war. In peace time they will be rendered much more efficient for
         the rescue of shipwrecked people by the system of communicating intelligence now being
         developed. This system is being worked out by the Treasury Department (to which the
         Coast Guard belongs) in cooperation with the navy. But, under the new law, the minute
         war breaks out, the Coast Guard, with all its appurtenances, including the vessels
         of what hitherto has been called the Revenue Cutter Service, automatically becomes
         part of the navy; the peace organization is transformed at an hour's notice into a
         force for military employment.

   <h4>Shall I Drink With My Meals?</h4>
   
   <div class="byline">By 
      <span class="persName">EDWIN F. BOWERS, M.D.</span> 
   </div>
   
   
   <div class="note">
      <em>Each week Dr. Bowers will answer the most interesting question he receives</em>
   </div>
   
   
   <p>A SURPRISING number of people are interested in knowing whether or not they should
      drink while eating.
      Yet it is not surprising that they should ask, since even the medical fraternity,
      until a recent yesterday, were divided on this subject.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Drinking with meals was generally held to contribute to laziness in chewing—large
      and indigestible boluses of insufficiently masticated food being "washed down" by
      copious draughts of tea, coffee, water, beer, or other liquids. These beverages were
      believed to dilute the gastric juices to such an extent that the pepsin and hydrochloric
      acid were rendered too weak to carry forward peptic digestion—to convert albumens
      into peptones.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Consequently, the cure for most of the manifold digestive ailments affecting human
      beings consisted in "dry diet." Liberal quantities of water were given a half hour
      or more before each meal, to wash out the accumulated mucous secretions and prepare
      the stomach for the ordeal of wrestling with a mass of nutriment. This was required
      to be eaten entirely without liquid aid—except as furnished by the saliva. Dry diet
      had one decided advantage, in that the excitable, hurrying possessor of the recalcitrant
      stomach had to chew and thoroughly in-salivate his food in order to avoid choking
      when he gulped it down.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>In so far as "dry diet" made for a more thorough trituration of the food particles,
      and an increased insalivation of the food, this was most excellent, and many dyspeptics,
      whose chief sin consisted in "bolting," were cured.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>But we now know, as the result of painstaking experiments and analyses of test meals,
      that a reasonable amount of fluid with the food serves only to dilute it and bring
      it in contact with a larger number of stomach glands than would be the case were it
      undiluted. This contact stimulates, probably by physiological irritation, the amount
      of gastric juice secreted, and also assists in the churning (or peristaltic) action
      of the stomach, thus hastening digestion.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>It has been contended that the cornparative freedom from dyspepsia existing among
      the Italians and French is due to their habit of drinking diluted wine with meals.
      This would be excellent reasoning„ except for the fact that alcohol with meals—in
      any form or in any amount—retards digestion.
   </p>
   
   
   <p>Perhaps, however, the safest rule to govern eating and drinking is to take only one
      thing at a time in the mouth. This will, of course, compel mastication and the free
      flow of saliva, while at the same time it will dilute the stomach content so that
      a maximum amount of digestion can be accomplished in a minimum length of time.
