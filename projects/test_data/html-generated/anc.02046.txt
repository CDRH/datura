"walter dear": The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son Walt


Louisa Van Velsor Whitman closed a letter to Walt three times with the short  command,
"burn this letter."Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman, December 15–19, 1868, March 7–May 15, 1871, and June 13, 1871 letters to Walt Whitman.  Her desire that what she had written would not be shared after the moment's  frustration
had passed—her anger that her visiting son Thomas Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman  and his
wife Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman had not paid for the food that they had consumed,
or her frustration that son George Washington Whitman was no longer as generous to
her  as formerly—signals her deep trust in the poet. She shared her complaints with
him as a confidant. Louisa relied on Walt to ease the irritations endemic to limited
financial  means—which he did by enclosing small sums of cash in most  of his letters
to her—and she was able to manage the  everyday frustrations of working-class life
by putting her annoyance  into the written word.

The letters that she wished Walt to destroy—witness today that at least in some  instances
he neglected her wishes or chose to disregard her will—are deeply  disquieting. They
remind us that her letters were personal and not public, intended  by Louisa for Walt
but also to be forwarded—or not—only within the  family. But we should not be naïve
about Walt's violation of Louisa's trust:  she well knew that he sometimes forwarded
her letters within the family as a  reminder or rebuke, and her letter of complaint
to Walt carried both the risk and promise  that he would intervene on her behalf.
Her faith in Walt was not  absolute, for she sometimes chose to spare him the full
truth. On December 4, 1863, the body of her deceased son Andrew Jackson Whitman laid
in  state on another floor of the Portland Avenue house. That evening Louisa's eldest
and mentally disturbed son Jesse Whitman had a vicious outburst toward Jeff's wife
Mattie  and their three-year-old daughter Manahatta. When Louisa described Andrew's
death to  Walt on the evening that Andrew died, she closed her letter with the phrase
"composed and ca[lm?]"  and had no intent to distract from the solemnity that she
wished to convey by including a description of Jesse's outburst. She added to her
letter the next day because she feared that  Jeff would send Walt a more inflammatory
account. With her initial hope to withhold from Walt the full extent  of the previous
night's episode with Jesse,  Louisa may have sought to avoid compounding the desolation
of grief.

Her December 4–5, 1863 letter has an affinity to the tenderness in Walt's best-known
Civil War poetry: her private letters, whose complaints are directed at those who
are long dead, have blended into Walt's purpose in preserving them as a memorial of
their relationship. That I edit them and that the Walt Whitman Archive publishes them are only the most recent acts, which build on the efforts of generations,
that of Walt and his disciple-executors, of collectors and archivists, and of scholars
and funding bodies who have undertaken and supported their preservation and study.
Her letters offer insight into Walt's life, but they are more important for their
insights into Louisa's own life as a subject worthy of our attention today.

Walt ensured that a large number of Louisa's letters to him would be preserved, and
recent scholars have offered sympathetic readings of them. But she remains a  challenging
figure because one of Walt's most well-known statements about her  influence on him
touches the core of his great poem. Walt claimed, in conversation  with Horace L.
Traubel, that she was "illiterate in the formal sense" but that Leaves of Grass was the "flower of her temperament active in me."Horace Traubel, With Walt Whitman in Camden (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1915), 2:113. Walt's conceit about his mother's importance resists critical analysis, but the many
readings of that quotation, especially whether one emphasizes the word "temperament"
or "illiterate," do provide a rough index to the sometimes overlapping periods in
the critical commentary on Louisa. Walt's early disciples emphasized her temperament
as an influence on his poetry in the context of Victorian motherhood (1880–1940);
this early Louisa, the ideal that Walt celebrated, gave way to a phase that emphasized
the great poet's struggle to overcome his domineering mother (1940–1970). After scholarly
critics agreed that Louisa's malevolent dominance was fundamental to Walt's psychological
makeup, her illiteracy emerged (1960–1995) as a necessary aspect of her malevolent
influence, part of the temperament that Walt had to overcome. The present period (1996– )
has rejected her corrosive psychological influence and instead leaned on Walt's qualification
"formal sense," a phase of criticism that has inspired close reading of her archival
letters both as cultural documents and as contributions to Walt's poetic voice. After
a brief review of this critical heritage, I will examine a passage from a May 1868
letter that may suggest to some the grounds for her illiteracy. I will argue instead
that it illustrates Walt's claim, in the same August 1888 conversation with Traubel,
for his mother's "great mimetic power."Traubel, With Walt Whitman in Camden 2:114.

Walt's disciples echoed his insistence on Louisa's robust health and celebrated her
admirable temperament, but the matter of her literacy was of no consequence for the
ideology of Republican motherhood that he extolled in Democratic  Vistas (1871)—and for which he offered his mother as an exemplar.  John Burroughs, after
an 1868 visit to Brooklyn, described her: "A spry, vivacious,  handsome old lady,
worthy of her illustrious son." Later, he blessed Walt's opinion  that she was the
"perfect woman and mother."John  Burroughs, June 1868 letter to Ursula North Burroughs, quoted in Clara Barrus,
Whitman and Burroughs Comrades (Boston: Houghton Mifflin,  1931), 57. Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person, 2nd  ed. (New York: Redfield, 1871), 79. A recent reviewer of Whitman  biographies deadpanned that Burroughs's descriptions
of her "could have been  embroidered on a Victorian sampler."Jeffrey  Meyers, "Whitman's Lives," The Antioch Review 63.4  (October 1, 2005), 764. Another disciple, Richard Maurice Bucke, praised  her as "remarkably healthy and
strong, had a kind, generous heart, good sense, and a  cheerful and even temper."Richard  Maurice Bucke, Walt Whitman (Glasgow: Wilson &amp;  McCormick, 1884), 15. For Walt, who believed in ancestral inheritance of  personal qualities, his own claims
for good health and good habits required a  parent, his mother, to bestow them. His
celebration of her temperament and health went unquestioned by his earliest disciples,
and her illiteracy was a matter of no moment.

Louisa's illiteracy emerged as a topic slightly later, with the first generation of
Whitman's scholarly biographers, who sought a psychological subtext within Walt's
family background that his poetry could transcend. The Louisa who served this purpose
was granted a functional literacy but denied the ability to understand Walt's poetry.
Walt's brother George in conversation with Traubel had claimed that both he and his
mother found Leaves of Grass incomprehensible: "Mother thought as I did—did not know what to make of it. [. .
. .] I remember mother comparing Hiawatha to Walt's, and the one seemed to us pretty
much the same muddle as the other. Mother said that if Hiawatha was poetry, perhaps
Walt's was."Horace L. Traubel, "Notes from Conversations with George W. Whitman, 1893: Mostly
in His Own Words," in In Re Walt Whitman, ed. Horace L. Traubel, Richard Maurice Bucke, and Thomas B. Harned (Philadelphia:
David McKay, 1893), 35–36. "Hiawatha" refers to Henry Wadsworth Longfellow's Song of Hiawatha (1855), a popular poem and exact contemporary to the first edition of Leaves of Grass. Because Louisa's inability to understand her son's poetry seemed the precondition
for the stunted psychological growth that he overcame in his poetry—but not in his
personal and sexual life—Henry Seidel Canby makes her temperament a fundamental quality:
"she was one of those ample women, wise and of great heart, who powerfully hold together
families and succeed by character and love." For her literacy, by contrast, Canby
resorts to an odd paradox, that she was "as near illiterate as one can be who can
read and write."Henry Seidel Canby, Walt Whitman, an American: a Study in Biography (Boston: Houghton Mifflin, 1943), 12, 13. These hints at her illiteracy would not yet hold sway in criticism: two early studies,
Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver's selection of family letters and Gay Wilson Allen's
biography, were exceptionally sympathetic toward Louisa. Faint Clews &amp; Indirections (1949) offers the full text of fifteen of her letters, and Gohdes and Silver detect
a "noble lustre" in her eyes.Clarence Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, Faint Clews &amp; Indirections: Manuscripts of Walt Whitman and Family (New York: AMS Press, 1965; rpt. Duke University Press, 1949), 184–205, 180–181,
185. In The Solitary Singer (1949) Allen reported George's opinion as representative of the entire Whitman family's
attitude toward Walt's poetry—that they could not  "understand it when it was in print"—but
he quoted also from many of Louisa's letters, including her comments on reviews of
Walt's poetry, and thereby affirmed her basic literacy.Gay Wilson Allen, The Solitary Singer: A Critical Biography of Walt Whitman (1955; rev. ed. New York: New York University Press, 1967), 203, 308, 361.

A scholar of the succeeding generation, Edwin Haviland Miller, did not label Louisa
illiterate but did insist that her personality was a psychologically debilitating
burden for the poet. In Walt Whitman's Poetry: A Psychological  Journey (1968), Miller referred to Louisa's "aggressive nature," her "emasculating  rule"
over the family, and the "nagging querulousness" in her letters.Edwin Haviland Miller, Walt Whitman's Poetry: A Psychological Journey (New York:  New York University Press, 1968), 48, 55. Miller, editor of  the The Correspondence (1961–1977),  extended the influence of his emphasis on familial burdens in his 
explanatory annotations to the letters, which when citing Louisa's letters often 
highlight her complaints, lack of humor, and bitterness. After psychological  readings
became widespread in literary biography—and domineering mothers were  identified as
a cause for homosexualityFor historical phases in psychoanalytic theory on causes for  homosexuality, see Jack
Drescher, "A History of Homosexuality and Organized Psychoanalysis," Journal of The American Academy of Psychoanalysis and Dynamic Psychiatry 36 (2008), 443–460; and "Causes and Becauses: On Etiological Theories of Homosexuality,"
Annual of Psychoanalysis 30 (2002), 58–59.—critics assumed that Louisa's illiteracy could underscore the familial influences
that Walt overcame: one called her "illiterate" and referred to her "inability to
read," and another designated her a "semi-literate mother." Larzer Ziff, Literary Democracy: the Declaration of Cultural Independence in America (New York: Viking Press, 1981), 233. Paul Zweig, Walt Whitman: The Making of the Poet (New York: Basic Books, 1984), 116.

These two related phases of Whitman scholarship, which lasted from the 1940s into
the  1990s, are now long past but are the foreground from which the current phase
of more  sympathetic interest in Louisa emerged. Studies by Sherry Ceniza and by Michael
Moon  and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, all of whom read widely within the archival letters,
offer a far more sympathetic portrait of Louisa. Ceniza argues that the absence of
punctuation in her writing is not a fault but a stylistic virtue: "her letters begin
to take on a life of their own, demanding a new relationship between the reader and
text." She also counters Miller's Correspondence annotations with expanded contextual analysis, and she notes that many critics' statements
on the poet's mother are factually inaccurate.Sherry Ceniza, Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers (Tuscaloosa: University of Alabama Press, 1998), 21, 13–15. Sedgwick and Moon quote from many of Louisa's letters: the former offers Walt's relationship
with his mother as a partial antidote to "the whole landscape of thinking about gay
men and their mothers," and the latter catalogs Louisa's linguistic gifts, her "sheer
love of articulation and narration" and her "pithy framing of pitiless truths." Michael Moon and Eve Kosofsky Sedgwick, "Confusion of Tongues," Breaking Bounds: Whitman and American Cultural Studies, ed. Betsy Erkkila and Jay Grossman (New York: Oxford University Press, 1996), 25–26. Whitman's recent scholarly biographers—Justin Kaplan, Jerome Loving, and David S.
Reynolds—have offered sympathetic (but not extended) analyses of his relationship
to Louisa. By contrast, Robert Roper in Now the Drum of War (2008), his family biography of the Civil War years, refers to Louisa's letters in
the Trent Collection at Duke University as one of the "true treasures [that] helped
shape my sense of the inner life of the Whitman family." He quotes Louisa's letters
extensively and lauds her "quicksilver intelligence and unostentatious decency."Robert Roper, Now the Drum of War: Walt Whitman and His Brothers in the Civil War (New York: Walker, 2008), 382, 9, 69–81, 202. Given this transformation in critical opinion, the present moment is apt to initiate
a new phase of study by making all of her known letters to Walt available in facsimile
and annotated transcription, available both to scholars and to the general public.

Attempting to read the letters, some may find that her unmarked syntactic units offer
significant challenges, but the manuscripts nonetheless remain essential documents
for family biography. The letters enrich Walt's biography from the publication of
the 1860 Leaves of Grass through his Civil War hospital work, during Reconstruction when first William D.
O'Connor and others began elevating his reputation as a poet, and through the intense
period of correspondence between Walt's January 1873 stroke and Louisa's death in
May of the same year. Her letters to a brief extent also comment on periods in her
life preceding the letters. The newly identified and newly dated letters in this edition—the
first comprehensive analysis undertaken—offer a rich portrait of her life, of Walt's
close emotional affinity to her and of her emotional and financial dependence upon
him, and of family dramas during just over a dozen years. This digital edition, "walter dear": The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son Walt, includes this introduction and one hundred seventy letters from her to him. This
edition corrects some misunderstandings about Whitman family biography, and it offers
Louisa the opportunity to put to rest questions about her literacy, to assert her
dignity in her own words, and—though an editor cannot escape complicity in Walt's
effort to shape his mother's memory—to complicate some of Walt's efforts to shape
her legacy and his own.

When encountering her letters for the first time, hold in mind Louisa's insistence
to  her own son that the reader bears the burden of understanding. She once reminded
Walt that he might need to expend effort to grasp her message: "if you cant  understand
walter dear you must read it over two or three times)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 23, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman.  Louisa's "walter dear" would not have found her demand off-putting: he sympathized
with her concerns, read her letters in series (most no more than a day or two after
she wrote them), and was long accustomed to extracting phrases from a stream of  words
unbroken by formal punctuation. In a mid-May 1868 letter, she  described a household
incident from the day before, and it is one of the more  challenging passages in the
entire letters corpus: 
 
   
Edd came up stairs yesterday towards evening before the eagle  came the eagle came
down stairs and the man i think is a democ[rat?] he said to Edd the radicals were
all down or something to that affect so eddy came up like mad saying they had cleared
the bugge[rs?] and he would never have any thing more to doo withe them i how doo
you know he is clear he said it was in the eagle that it wou[ld?] be better to have
no congress at all than to doo as they had it was quite amusing to see eddy is such
a gale but when i got the paper i see how things were)Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 13–18, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman.
 
  

Editorial transcription will of course aid reading for those unfamiliar with her hand,
but transcription adds complexity of another sort. The characters in square brackets
are not fully legible in the manuscript, and the question mark before the closing
bracket signals uncertainty. Even when transcribed, however, her words are unfamiliar
in a dual sense: they are not from family and are removed in time from our own moment
as readers. Scholarly annotation is needed to provide basic personal and cultural
contexts. In this case, the "eagle" is the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, a Democratic-leaning newspaper; Edward (Edd) is her mentally and physically disabled
son; and the unnamed man downstairs identifies with the Democratic party. Louisa generally
preferred Republican ideals: her son George had risked his life in war, and Walt's
employment was under Republican administrations, as a clerk in the nation's capital.
Both Louisa and George agreed that the efforts of Radical Republicans to reassert
control over Reconstruction and to impeach Andrew Johnson were justified, though Louisa
became ambivalent about the prospect of removing the president from office.

Nonetheless, even with these basic contexts understood, Louisa's act of mimicry places
real demands on readers. She reported to Walt Edward's exchange with the unnamed Democrat
and her teasing interaction with Edward as he struggled to convey the exchange to
her. After the Democrat said "the radicals were all down," Edward became agitated.
Louisa dramatizes Edward's report of the Democrat's words, her interruption to seek
clarification, and her son's growing exasperation. Yet her disregard of conventional
punctuation may well threaten our ability to understand her: "he would never have
any thing more to doo withe them i how doo you know he is clear he said." A reader
can easily lose track of who "he" is—Edward or the Democrat—and what "he" says. The
key word is "i," which marks a change in speakers.

The passage can be rendered more straightforward by marking syntactic units with 
punctuation and by adding explanatory words: "I [said], 'how do you know?' Edd is
clear [the Democrat] said, 'it was in the eagle [….]' It [Edd's reaction] was  quite
amusing […]." This annotated quotation-paraphrase offers a  reasonable reading, but
it is not the only one that a reader could devise. Alternate  readings and disagreements
about emphasis are to be expected when serious readers  take up these transcriptions
and their manuscript source, but this short  passage—you might try reading it a second
or third time—demonstrates  what Walt considered her "mimetic power": she performs
with remarkable economy both  Edward's encounter with the Democrat and her conversation
with Edward in a mere one  hundred fifteen words. As Ceniza has suggested, Louisa's
words will  "take on a life  of their own" in other minds.Ceniza,  Walt Whitman and 19th-Century  Women Reformers, 21.

Louisa's letters generally lack  punctuation aside from one mark that resembles a
closing parenthesis, and her  spelling is inconsistent and sometimes phonetic for
rarely used words. It is  unlikely that she had access to primary schooling or tutoring,
and one can detect no  hint of formal instruction in writing. But she nonetheless
managed from a smattering  of instruction, access to printed and handwritten texts,
and force of will to acquire the  ability to write. What her letters lack in conventional
correctness—and we  should be cautious even about that conclusion because manuscripts
from early  nineteenth-century authors often seem careless to us when regarded with
the standards for spelling and syntactical punctuation in later decades—is of little
matter against their considerable power and expressiveness. That is what Walt's qualification
"formal sense" must mean, and Ceniza's description of her writing with Walt's phrase
"family usages" from "There Was a Child Went Forth" is apt.Ceniza, Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers, 21. Her private letters are her only known writing, but they exhibit a substantially
realized power of verbal expression. The remainder of this introduction—before it
turns to editorial policies—provides a biography of her life before the  letters,
a review of her life in the periods during which her letters are extant,  notes on
how her newly edited letters alter previously assumed details about Whitman  family
lives, and a review of how her letters can contribute to a better understanding of
her relationship to Walt and can help to identify possible influences on his poetry. 



 
Early Life  
The biographical notes on the early life of Louisa Van Velsor, born on September 22,
1795 to Cornelius Van Velsor (1768–1837) and Naomi "Amy" Williams  (1762–1826), are
drawn from the poet's recollections to John Burroughs in Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person (1871) and from  those same recollections again refracted through Walt's memory in
Specimen Days (1882) and in his conversations with Traubel. The Van Velsor homestead was on Long
Island, and Walt in Specimen Days described his grandfather, "The Major," who bred horses, as "jovial, red, stout,
with sonorous voice."Walt Whitman, Specimen Days &amp; Collect (Philadelphia: Rees Welsh, 1882–1883), 11. Amy Williams was descended from a sea-faring family: Louisa's maternal grandfather
John Williams and his only son died at sea. Walt described his maternal grandmother
Amy as "a Friend, or Quakeress, of sweet, sensible character, housewifely proclivities,
and deeply intuitive and spiritual."Burroughs, Notes on Walt Whitman, quoted in Whitman, Specimen Days, 12. Walt's mother Louisa was not a practicing Quaker herself, but Walt insisted that
"her leanings were that way—her sympathies: her fundamental emotional tendencies."Horace Traubel, With Walt Whitman in Camden (New York: Mitchell Kennerley, 1914), 3:109. And he emphasized her robust health, describing her in youth as a "daily and daring
rider."Whitman, Specimen Days, 11.


Walt's remarks on his Van Velsor ancestors and his mother's health before her  marriage
and through his own early adulthood should be accepted with caution, if  accepted
at all. Many of Louisa's children suffered ill health, both mental and  physical:
Walt himself had signs of hypertension in his forties and suffered a  serious stroke
in his fifties. He was well past middle age when he recounted his  family history
to Burroughs, so he may exhibit his mother's splendid health in her  youth—like her
temperament—for the purpose of poetic self-fashioning. Be  that as it may, Louisa
when a young woman was courted by Walter Whitman, Sr.  (1789–1855), a skilled carpenter
who had built a house near a twenty-acre  apple orchard on West Hills; they married
in June 1816.Joseph Jay Rubin, The Historic Whitman  (University Park: Pennsylvania State University Press, 1973), 10. The  farming homestead from which the family of Walter, Sr., hailed at the turn of
the  century represented comparative wealth in land and slaves.Burroughs, Notes on Walt Whitman, quoted in  Whitman, Specimen Days, 11. But Walter, Sr., was  reduced in social and economic status to subsistence farming.
The Whitman family's  financial difficulties stretched back at least a decade before
the marriage, which  may be why Walter, Sr., in his teens was apprenticed as a carpenter
to Jacob  Whitman, an older cousin, in New York.Roper, Now the Drum of War, 18. There Walt's father likely encountered Thomas Paine, the Revolutionary figure with
the greatest appeal to the working class and artisans of the era. We know little of
Louisa's future husband as a young man, but we may speculate that he like his son
was able to wander freely in New York streets during an era marked by enthusiasm for
the possibilities of public education and religious and social reform but also by
laissez faire acceptance of poverty, prostitution, cheap drink, and public entertainments
that would periodically devolve into violence.

Louisa as a young woman may well have shared her husband's enthusiasm for the social
promises   of a reforming age—Walter, Sr., is well known for his admiration of Quaker
reformer   Elias Hicks and woman's rights advocate Frances WrightJohn Rietz, "Whitman, Walter, Sr. [1789-1855]," Walt   Whitman: An Encyclopedia, ed. J.R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998). Available
http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_71.html.—and   her extended reading of newspapers and magazines during the years in which
her letters   survive suggest that she followed the same social currents in young
adulthood that her   husband did. Neither Walter, Sr., nor Louisa were members of
an organized church, but the   Whitman children may have received some education in
Brooklyn's church-affiliated primary   schools, including the Episcopal and Dutch
Reformed.Floyd   Stovall, The Foregrounds of Leaves of Grass (Charlottesville:   University Press of Virginia, 1974), 24. Louisa shared her husband's admiration   for Hicks, who preached the value of Inner
Light against the authority of ordained clergy,   and Walt credited his mother for
introducing him to Hicks.Horace Traubel, "Whitman in Old Age: From Horace Traubel's Record," Century Illustrated Monthly Magazine 74 (1907), 749. Walt's brother George claimed that their mother "pretended to be a Baptist": the
matter of "pretending" cannot be documented in her letters, but she found the words
of a Baptist minister consoling after her husband's funeral in 1855.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, July 13–18?, 1855 letter to Hannah Whitman Heyde, quoted
in Clifton Joseph Furness, Review of American Giant: Walt Whitman and his Times, by Frances Winwar, American Literature 14 (January 1942), 427. Her youngest son Edward was a devout parishioner of Henry Ward Beecher's Plymouth
Church, though Louisa never mentioned joining him there herself. She was not devout
and adhered to no particular creed, but the death of two sons and a daughter-in-law
drew from her expressions of resignation to the will of a higher power.

Initial aspirations that Louisa and her husband shared of an intellectual or public
reform bent must have been dampened by the hardships—financial and physical—that marked
their early marriage. For Louisa the two- and three-year cycles of pregnancy and childbirth
that dominated her life between 1818 and 1835 surely exacted a physical and emotional
toll. Before the second anniversary of her marriage, she gave birth on March 2, 1818
to her first son Jesse, and Walter followed on May 31, 1819. (The poet would be known
generally in his family as Walt, but Louisa's letters refer often to her son by his
full name Walter.) The birth of Louisa's first daughter Mary Elizabeth followed just
under two years after the poet's, on February 3, 1821. We have no Whitman family accounts
from this period, but the year of Jesse's birth coincided with the beginning of widespread
suffering among working class people following the "Panic of 1818," a period known
colloquially as "hard times." London banks reined in credit at the conclusion of the
Napoleonic conflicts, and the credit contraction cycled into North America. The newly-formed
Bank of the United States squeezed state banks, which in turn stopped redeeming paper
specie with gold and called in their loans from tenant farmers.For the "Panic of 1818," see Daniel Walker Howe, What Hath God Wrought: the Transformation of America, 1815–1848 (New York: Oxford University Press, 2007), 142–143. Reduced to subsistence farming and cutting firewood instead of skilled carpentry,
Walter, Sr., sold the West Hills homestead in 1823, a choice that reflected personal
financial hardship but was in accord with the wider economic turmoil of the period.

On May 27, 1823, Walter, Sr., moved Louisa and their three children under five years
of age to the port city of Brooklyn, thirty miles west, at the mouth end of Walt's
"fish-shape Paumanok," Long Island. They settled into a rented house on Front Street
near Main Street, also known as New Ferry Road.Allen, Solitary Singer, 1, 3, 5. But  settled is an inapt word because the family's first decade in  Brooklyn was marked by dizzying
address changes and childbirths. Louisa, already  pregnant when the family departed
West Hills, gave birth to daughter Hannah Louisa Whitman in Brooklyn on November 28,
1823.Rubin, Historic Whitman, 12. Shortly after Hannah's birth, the family moved to Cranberry Street, and then in September
1824 Walter, Sr., purchased a lot on the corner of Washington and Johnson. With this
purchase he began speculative housebuilding, a business that his sons Walt and George
would later follow, which ideally produced a cycle of "buy, build, sell, and move
all over again."Allen, Solitary Singer, 7. According to Walt, the first houses on Front, Cranberry, and Johnson Street (at the
corner of Washington) were "mortgaged, and we lost them."Whitman, Specimen Days, 14. Even the ideal cycle of such a business could hardly have been welcome for a mother
with many young children—and Louisa's later letters show a distaste for moving—but
Louisa's other sources of grief during this period may have made financial hardship
secondary. A son, who was never christened, was born to Louisa and Walter, Sr., in
March 1825, and died six months later on September 14, 1825.Birth date of unnamed infant son: March 12, 1825, Whitman Family Bible, Library of
Congress, Loving, Walt Whitman, illus. after page 208; or March 2, 1825, Richard Maurice Bucke, Family Records, Solitary Singer, 596, 597, n. 6. Louisa's mother Amy Williams died in February 1826, compounding her grief during
one of the darkest periods of her life.

The family's subsequent Brooklyn homes were on Van Dykes (1826), Adams (1827),  Tillary
(May 1827), and another house also on Tillary and Adams, probably the one at  which
the family remained from late 1827 through November 1831, which was followed  by a
move to Henry Street.Walt Whitman,  Manuscript Notebook 4, The Uncollected Poetry and Prose of  Walt Whitman: Much of Which Has Been but Recently
Discovered with Various  Early Manuscripts Now First Published, ed. Emory Holloway (Garden City, New York: Doubleday, Page, 1921), 2:86. Allen,
Solitary Singer, 7. For list of mortgages, see Katherine  Molinoff, "Property Transfers of the Whitman
Family," Allen, Appendix B,  598–600. Walt's manuscript is difficult to square with
incomplete property records. The real estate records are incomplete, but it is quite likely, as David S. Reynolds
surmises, that the first house on Johnson and one of the houses on Tillary were not
part of a buy-build-sell cycle but were mortgaged, lost, and subsequently rented back.Allen, Solitary Singer, 598–599. David S. Reynolds, Walt Whitman's America: A Cultural Biography (New York: Alfred A. Knopf, 1996), 25. Just before the first move to a house on Tillary, Louisa bore the first of three
sons to be named after a former American president, Andrew Jackson Whitman on April
7, 1827. The two sons who followed in approximately three-year intervals also bore
presidential namesakes, George Washington Whitman on November 28, 1829 and Thomas
Jefferson "Jeff" Whitman on July 18, 1833. At the time of Jeff's birth, the older
children, from Jesse through Andrew, were attending or (within five or six years)
had matriculated through a public primary school in Brooklyn on Adams and Concord
Streets. Tutors and private schools had long served the social and economic elite,
but public schooling for families like the Whitmans was another concrete sign of possibilities
in a reforming age and an opportunity to cultivate a range of social acquaintances.Allen, Solitary Singer, 10. Edward Folsom and Kenneth M. Price, "Walt Whitman," Walt Whitman Archive, http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/walt_whitman/index.html.

The conditions of Louisa's early marriage must remain speculative, but Walt's  memories
and some comments in her letters suggest that she was deeply unhappy.  Walter, Sr.,
was unlikely to have aided with the mundane but grueling tasks of  childcare and housework—scrubbing
clothes and floors, canning, baking, and  daily cooking—and such stresses along with
serial childbirths may have  contributed to the extended illness or depression that
followed Jeff's birth. One  telling remark about Louisa's childbearing years appears
in her letters. Her  daughter-in-law Louisa Orr Haslam Whitman (referred to in this
introduction as "Louisa Orr" to distinguish her), who was suspected pregnant, was
confined to bed, carried by her husband up and down the stairs, and attended by an
aunt, an ordering of affairs that surprised Louisa: "its seems so different from what
i have always had to go through)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 3, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman.

Further, Walter, Sr., may have contributed significantly to his wife's suffering,
especially  if his frustrations with financial setbacks and his probable dependency
on alcohol  led to emotional and physical abuse. According to Reynolds, one cause
for financial  hardship may have been that Walter, Sr., insisted on handcrafted work,
which made it  difficult for him to compete with "the more modern technique of prefabricated
parts  installed by specialized workers."Reynolds, Walt Whitman's America, 25. According to  Burroughs, Walt recalled his father as having been "one time addicted
to  alcohol."Cited in Barrus, Whitman and Burroughs Comrades, 254. Jerome M. Loving  identifies alcoholism, the compulsion that also wracked Walt's
brothers Jesse and  Andrew, as a possible contributor to the failed mortgages of Walter,
Sr., in the  early Brooklyn years.Loving, Walt Whitman: The Song of Himself, 30. The poet's  "father" in  Leaves of Grass (1855)—"strong,  selfsufficient, manly, mean, angered, unjust / The blow, the quick
loud  word"—may well reflect some qualities of the relationship between Walter, Sr.,
and his son, as many biographers assume. The same qualities would have made him a
difficult or, more accurately, abusive husband. Louisa's letters support  a reasonable
suspicion that she endured in marriage episodes of physical or  emotional abuse. Louisa
did not describe her own marriage, but her  description of verbal and physical altercations
in other marriages—some of which  include physical violence and emotional harassment—suggest
that behavior  which by today's standards might qualify as spousal abuse seemed to
her  a familiar part of married life. When her son Andrew went on drinking binges,
Louisa blamed  his doing so on the poor housekeeping of his wife Nancy.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 25 or October 2, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. The husband of Louisa's neighbor Janey (or Jenne) Chapell "knocked her down":  Louisa
approved Janey's fighting spirit in such encounters with her  husband—"gives as much
back as she gets"—and disparaged  her own daughter Hannah's silent suffering in response
to her husband  Charles Heyde's verbal abuse.Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman, March 31, 1869 letter to Walt  Whitman.   

One of the few positive mentions of the temperament of Walter, Sr., appears in Walt's
September 1863 letter to his mother, in which a soldier who "often made me think of
father" is described as "large, slow, good natured" and "shrewd, very little to  say."Walt Whitman, September 15, 1863 letter to Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman. Yet if what Louisa endured as a young woman did not approach the  obvious abuse that
her neighbor Janey suffered decades later, the phrase "little to  say" also delineates
a significant difference between husband and wife. Louisa was a  gifted conversationalist
and probably quite voluble. The Louisa of the letters was  socially engaged, read
multiple periodicals, and cultivated a wide circle of  friends. She visited many of
Walt's and Jeff's friends and had a wide network of her  own, including Abby Price
and her two daughters, neighbors Grace Haight, Mrs. Black,  and Margret Steers, and
Anna Van Wyck. Louisa's Myrtle Street friend Grace Haight  recalled her gift for conversation:
a rap at Louisa's door elicited the call "come  in" and the greeting "How do you do,
Grace," both familiar preludes to "pleasantly  pass[ing?] an evening with you" engaged
in talk and harmless gossip.Grace Haight, September  22, 1872 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Feinberg Collection,  Library of Congress). Louisa's surviving letters to Walt mention her husband of almost  thirty-nine years
only twice, once after Andrew's December 1863 death—her son  has been buried as close
as possible to his father's grave—and a second time several  years later to recall
that the wish of Walter, Sr., to everyone was "good luck to  you."Louisa  Van Velsor Whitman, February 17, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman.   

Shortly before Jeff's birth in 1833, the family departed Brooklyn to return to West
Hills, and from this period Walt's early writings and his later recollections  suggest
that Louisa's health was seriously compromised and that he, when a young  teen, began
both to rebel against his father and to assume a semi-parental role for  his siblings.
The family, though not the two eldest sons Jesse and Walt, the latter  a printer's
apprentice in New York, departed Brooklyn in May 1833 and settled in  Norwich in 1834.Allen, Solitary Singer, 22, 24. The disposition of Walter,  Sr., to drink and his many failed financial transactions
may have led to the  family's removal from Brooklyn, but the family soon found relief
from financial  stress with the sale of a portion of inherited West Hills land for
$2,250.Rubin, Historic  Whitman, 32. The sale, which fell near the death of Hannah  Brush, the mother of Walter, Sr.,
preceded by about a year the birth  of the Whitmans youngest child Edward on August
9, 1835, who  suffered physical deformity of his limbs, epileptic seizures, and  limited
mental capacity. He remained in his mother's care until her death. Walt,  who visited
his family often during the period before Edward's birth, recalled that his mother
had been "very ill for a long time."Whitman, Specimen Days, 16.

The Whitman family spent the ten years from 1836 through 1845 in various rural Long
Island villages: Hempstead in May 1836, Babylon in August 1836, Long Swamp in spring
1837, and Smithtown in fall of the same year.Whitman, Manuscript Notebook 4, Uncollected  Poetry and Prose, 2:86. Walt taught in eight schools at  locations near his family but was eventually drawn
back to the newspaper and  printing trade.Loving, Walt  Whitman: The Song of Himself, 37–39 His "Our Boys and Girls,"  a sketch of reminiscence published in May 1844 but probably
drafted earlier,  provides a charming, though overdrawn and allegorical, portrait
of his siblings. One  "niece" and the three "nephews" in the sketch share the names
of four of Walt's  siblings, and the others, though unnamed, are easily identified.
Hannah, by her  middle name "Louisa," is the "fairest and most delicate of human blossoms,"
and her  toddler brother (Edward) is an "imp of mischief" with a "stout pair of dumpy
hands."  Walt reports formerly having carried his younger brother George Washington
on his  shoulders, having taught Thomas Jefferson to read, and wrestling with his
younger  brother Andrew Jackson. Walt issues a stern sentimental warning to the unnamed
Mary,  aged fourteen, a "beautiful girl": "Flattery comes too often to her ears."
According  to the sketch, two children in the family have died, a boy who was buried
"in the  early summer" and a girl was buried "a mere month only after she came into
the  world.""My Boys and Girls," The Rover, April 20, 1844. Reprinted in The  Early Poems and Sketches, ed. Thomas L. Brasher (New York: New York  University Press, 1963), 248–250. Because conventional sentiment  blends with autobiography in the sketch, a deceased
infant girl, not mentioned  elsewhere, is most likely a sentimental creation serving
the impulse  to balance the other lost child. Walt—aged 25 when the sketch was first
published but depicting the family in 1835 when he was in his teens—sketches himself
in the "exercise of a semi-parental role."Justin Kaplan, Walt Whitman: A Life (New York: Simon &amp; Schuster, 1980), 86. Kaplan speculates that the sketch was written
"long before then" (85). That Walt had begun to assume the role a decade earlier may also reflect a sentimental
revision, but he had replaced his father as the source for family necessities by the
time of the sketch's publication. Whatever anxieties Walt had entertained for his
sister Mary's future a decade before the sketch's publication had become moot: she
married Ansel Van Nostrand and moved to Greenport in May 1840, the same month that
the Whitman family moved again, to Dix Hills.Whitman, Uncollected Poetry and Prose, 2:87.

Robert Roper argues persuasively that Walt as a young journalist was enterprising
and ambitious and that during the Civil War he "worked until he collapsed."Roper,   Now the Drum of War, 33–34, 240. The same tendency toward hard work was present also   during his antebellum stint
as a housebuilder. Charles E. Feinberg concluded only that   Walt was "modestly successful
in business  matters" before publishing Leaves of Grass, but Feinberg debunked thoroughly the idle loafer of Walt's own poetic myth.Charles E. Feinberg, "A Whitman Collector Destroys a Whitman Myth," Papers of the Bibliographical Society of America 52 (Second Quarter, 1958), 91. Nonetheless, the constant moves that were required when building houses on speculation
with limited capital—practiced in Brooklyn first by Walter, Sr., from 1823 through
1833 and again in 1844, by his son Walt perhaps as early as 1845 but avidly between
1848 and 1854, and by Walt's brother George between 1866 and 1870—must have worn on
Louisa. She was dependent on each while he was engaged in the business, and subject
to its vagaries. The Whitman family returned to Brooklyn in 1844, where Walter, Sr.,
in October bought a lot on Prince Street. The family lived briefly on Gold Street
and then moved into a house that Walter, Sr., (probably with the assistance of his
sons Walt and George) had completed at 71 Prince Street, where Walt joined them.Allen, Solitary Singer, 68, 599. According to Feinberg, Walt (not his father) in 1845 purchased a lot on Prince Street,
and he built a house on 106 Myrtle Avenue to which the family moved in April 1848.
Walt sold that house in 1852 and moved the family to a two-story house on Cumberland
Street—Walt built two more houses on the same street—at which the family remained
for one year.Feinberg, "A Whitman Collector," 75, 78, 83, 87, 89. Molinoff, "Property Transfers,"
quoted in Allen, Solitary Singer, Appendix B, 598–600. Whitman, Manuscript Notebook 4, Uncollected Poetry and Prose, 2:88. When the receipts and real estate records assembled by Feinberg and Molinoff are
aligned to Walt's own manuscript record of the homes in which his family lived, the
constant impulse in Louisa's letters—to settle and remain in a modest house—is easily
understood. Children continued to depart the household—Hannah left Brooklyn for Vermont
after her marriage to Charles Heyde in 1852. That her children were older  may have
eased the physical burdens of Louisa's home life, but the housebuilding business had
prevented her finding a place to settle for an extended time. The Whitman family moved
to Skillman Street near Myrtle in April 1854.Feinberg, "A Whitman Collector," 89.

The year 1855 is well known for its significance in the poet's life, and it marked
an  epoch in his mother's as well: Walt purchased a home for Louisa in her own name
on  Ryerson Street in May and published Leaves of Grass in July.  Walter, Sr., died shortly after Walt's book was first offered for sale.
Louisa's  deed for the Ryerson Street house was intended to be permanent and out of
her husband's reach. A legally binding note gave her full power over the property
"without concurrence of her husband at any time during the present or any future couverture."Molinoff, "Property Transfers," quoted in Allen, Solitary Singer, 600. But of these three events in her life, only the Ryerson Street house would prove
impermanent. Walt again purchased a house for his mother at the corner of Graham and
Willoughby in April 1856, and the family moved to 77 Classon Avenue in May 1856, at
which Walt shared an upper attic with his brother Edward.Whitman, Manuscript Notebook 4, Uncollected Poetry and Prose, 2:88. Bronson Alcott's visit to the Classon Avenue house on November 9, 1856, accompanied
by Henry David Thoreau, supplies the earliest first-person account of Louisa, "a stately
sensible matron believing in Walter absolutely and telling us how good he was and
wise as a boy"; Alcott returned the next day and again chatted with Walt's "fond mother."Bronson Alcott, The Journals of Bronson Alcott, ed. Odell Shepard (Boston, Little Brown, 1938), 289, 290. Two more moves followed, to two different North Portland Avenue houses between May
1859 and 1860. The latter, a rental on North Portland near Myrtle Street with a portion
sublet to a family named Brown,Allen, Solitary Singer, 600, 216, 239–240. remained Louisa's home during the Civil War. Her earliest extant letters are addressed
to Walt in Boston, where he was supervising the preparation of the 1860 Leaves of Grass, and from this period forward her letters begin to complement Walt's and Jeff's as
the authoritative record for her final thirteen years of life. 
 

   

Louisa in the Time of the Letters 


Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's extant letters to Walt, which date from just before the
start of Civil War in 1860 through her death near the midpoint of Reconstruction in
1873, have a wide range of linguistic tenors, from moments of profound grief to gossipy
reports on day-to-day life. Because daily life generally included reading a newspaper,
the subjects in Louisa's letters also include public events that range from reviews
of Walt's poems to long-forgotten sensations in her city of Brooklyn. Any division
of her life or letters into sets risks emphasizing some aspects of her life over others.
With my choice to separate her letters into three basic periods I have highlighted
Louisa's sense of domestic stability, the factor that was fundamental to her sense
of emotional independence.
During the first period, 1860 through spring 1867, Louisa resided with her son Jeff
and his family for a span that enveloped the Civil War, and this period came to a
close when Jeff departed for St. Louis in spring 1867. The second period, from spring
1867 through summer 1872, could be divided in half but is treated as one period because
the years are those in which Louisa remained in Brooklyn with considerable personal
freedom despite financial dependence on son George's housebuilding business. During
the first part of this period, Louisa endured three years of temporary residences
as George's business was buffeted by postwar economic turmoil. Her housing uncertainty
during the first part of this period gave way to two years of general stability in
Brooklyn: Louisa achieved comparative independence—despite declining health and continuing
reliance on Walt for financial support—in a Portland Avenue home that George provided.
Toward the end of the second period, in spring 1871, George married Louisa Orr Haslam
and moved to Camden, New Jersey. Louisa remained in the city with son Edward as the
only constant presence among her immediate family, though George and his wife and
Walt visited frequently, the latter often for extended periods. The third period of
her letters, the most brief, began in fall 1872 with Louisa's arrival in Camden, where
she resided with George and Louisa Orr until her death in May 1873. The periods so
designated correspond roughly with the Civil War and Walt's hospital work   (period
1), early Reconstruction and the growth of Walt's public reputation as a poet   (period
2), and the election of Ulysses S. Grant to his second term in late 1872 and   Walt's
paralytic stroke in January 1873 (period 3). All three periods are marked by Louisa's
devotion to caring for her disabled son Edward and by her dependence upon and by her
unflagging devotion to Walt.

After an initial description of the general contours of   each period, I highlight
some of the most important letters with an emphasis on those   that illustrate Louisa's
personality and family relations. Louisa's letters have been   studied thoroughly
for factual detail by Walt's biographers and by previous editors of family letters,
so I place somewhat greater emphasis on the letters which suggest that scholars have
reached dubious or questionable conclusions about the social dynamic of her own interests
within Whitman family life. I address her life neither primarily as a lens on larger
social events nor as a reflection of her son Walt's life but as a working-class life
of interest on its own terms, one which offers secondary insight into these related
subjects. Notes on immediate family, on her children and on their families aside from
Walt follow discussion of the three periods. The introduction then turns to possible
implications of her letters for the study of Walt's life and writings before concluding
with matters of editorial policy. 




Period 1: 1860–1867  
Between 1860 and 1867, Louisa's life was fractured by the death of her son Andrew
Jackson Whitman, and her empathy for his wife Nancy and their three children was worn
down by the strains of the Civil War. Louisa in one sense was unusually fortunate:
despite having four sons of military age and of at least marginal physical suitability
only George and Andrew served and only George's service was extended and included
battle. Nonetheless, the economic and social upheaval of the war took a significant
toll on the Whitman family. During the period of her earliest extant letters, Walt
was in Boston to work with publisher Thayer &amp; Eldridge, but within little more than
two years Walt's letters about his hospital visits joined George's letters from the
front to bring the devastating costs of war directly to her. George's wounding at
Fredericksburg (December 1862) precipitated Walt's departure to the Washington, D.C.,
area and ultimately to his nursing wounded soldiers. The discovery that George had
been injured—the extent of his injury was unknown for several days—was rivaled in
intensity of worry and exceeded in duration by George's capture and imprisonment from
October 1864 through March 1865. Walt's letters to Louisa provide a record of the
family's emotional trauma and uncertainty upon learning that George was wounded at
Fredericksburg, but none of Louisa's letters during George's imprisonment survive,
except upon notice that his release was imminent. In the immediate postwar period,
demobilization produced mass layoffs at the United States Naval Yard, and Louisa within
months expressed her unease about crime in nearby Brooklyn parks and streets. The
family's departure in 1866 to a home that was adjacent to Prospect Park on Brooklyn's
outskirts may have been in response to the threat of crime. The new house, however,
was unpleasant for Louisa in part because she was away from friends and the bustle
of the city. The brief experiment in life at the city's edge ended with Jeff's departure
for St. Louis in 1867.

The earliest letters of this period—the handful to Walt in Boston and later in 1863
as Andrew's  death approached—offer insight both into family life and the vibrancy
of Louisa's interaction with Walt's social and intellectual circles. In April 1860,
Jeff conveyed his mother's request that Walt send a copy of James Redpath's biography
of John Brown, the abolitionist martyr.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, April 16, 1860 letter to Walt Whitman. The Public Life of Captain John Brown (1860) had been issued recently by Thayer &amp; Eldridge, the Boston publisher with which
Walt was preparing his revised 1860 edition of Leaves of Grass. In her early May 1860 letter, Louisa acknowledged receipt of the Brown biography
and described two recent visits to her home, one by Fred Vaughan and Robert "Bob"
Cooper, and one by Hector Tyndale. This letter has her only mention of Vaughan, Walt's
likely former lover and inspiration for the "Live Oak, with Moss" / "Calamus" sequence
of poems. Vaughan and his roommate Robert Cooper made an extended visit: "Fred and
bob coopper was here last sunday staid till toward evening)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 2–4, 1860 letter to Walt Whitman. Tyndale's visit, which was separate from that of Vaughan and Cooper, marked Walt's
and his family's continued connection to Ralph Waldo Emerson and his extended circles.
Tyndale's mother Sara Thorne, a Philadelphia abolitionist, had accompanied Alcott
and Thoreau when they visited Walt in 1855. During Tyndale's 1860 visit to Louisa
he described his mother Sara Thorne's suffering during her recent illness. Louisa
apparently made quite an impression on Tyndale, or so Walt reported three years later:
"[Tyndale] has been to see me again—always talks about you."Walt Whitman, June 29, 1866 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Two months before Tyndale's visit, Louisa had rented the ground floor in the Whitmans'
Portland Avenue home to the Brown family, which prompted in her letter an aside about
the tailor's "uncommon name."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 26–31, 1860 letter to Walt Whitman. Louisa's and Hector's shared interest in the abolitionist by that name—Tyndale had
retrieved Brown's body from Virginia for interment in New York—may have enlivened
their extended conversation.John M. McLaughlin, A Memoir of Hector Tyndale (Philadelphia: Collins, 1882), 7–9.

George's wounding and imprisonment were severe trials, but the most significant  moment
of family transition during the war was Andrew's death, which concluded the  extended
saga of his illness and forced the family into a series of wracking choices  on Louisa's
daughter-in-law, Nancy, and Louisa's eldest son Jesse. The jostling between Jeff and
his mother in their letters—each complained to Walt about the other—marks a household
in dissension. Andrew's throat pain was so severe during his last months that even
salted broth was unbearable, and he apparently survived mostly on rice pudding. Jeff
and Louisa agreed about Nancy's extravagance: Louisa objected even to Nancy's expenses
for food. On the other hand, Jeff accused his mother of scrimping unnecessarily on
food for herself and sons Edward and Jesse. According to Louisa, Andrew's son Jimmy
ate four eggs for breakfast when "other things not half so expensi[ve?] would be much
more healthy for the child."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 5–23, 1863 and September 25 or October 2, 1863 letters to Walt Whitman. According to Jeff, dinner for his mother, Jesse, and Edward consisted of "a quart
of tomats and a few cucumbers."Thomas Jefferson Whitman, September 5, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Walt like Jeff urged his mother to spend more freely on food: "I hope you will at
least four or five times a week have a steak of beef or mutton, or something substantial
for dinner."Walt Whitman, September 8, 1863 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Louisa ignored Jeff's advice (and Walt's) about spending on food and instead criticized
Jeff and his wife Mattie for spending so freely on themselves. In Louisa's view, they
had the means to be more generous to their nephew: "they never gave Jim one cent worth
when he went away not even a shirt when Jeff has 1[8?] mat said if they work and got
them as they had done they could have them."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 5–23?, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Shortly after Andrew's death, the previous aid that the Whitman family had provided
to Nancy and her children—including rent for September or October 1863According to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, "the landlord has told them they must [move]
so now they expect me tto pay the rent i told nanc i would pay one month" (September 5–23?, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman).—was replaced almost entirely by employment advice.

In the aftermath of Andrew's death, the Whitman family concentrated its energies 
instead on Louisa's oldest son Jesse, whose threatening behavior toward Jeff and Mattie's
daughter Manahatta, then three years old, and toward Mattie herself prompted a permanent
separation in the housing quarters. Louisa lived with sons Jesse and Edward in the
basement, while Jeff, Mattie, and their two daughters lived on the upper floor. Jeff
and Mattie  genuinely feared that Jesse's mental instability could escalate to physical
violence. Louisa minimized Jesse's outburst in her December 4–5 letter to  Walt, wherein
she described Andrew's death. Louisa failed to anticipate that Jeff in  mid-December
would send Walt a graphic description of the interfamilial conflict.  One of the conceits
about Louisa's relationship to Walt is that she placed absolute trust in him, but
in her letter she spared (or denied) him the full truth about Jesse's outburst because
she would not permit the episode to distract from the solemn dignity befitting her
own effort to memorialize Andrew.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 4–5, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman.

Jeff's mid-December letter to Walt contrasts markedly with Louisa's from ten days
earlier on the apparent violence of Jesse's threat.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, December 15, 1863  letter to Walt Whitman. After Walt responded to Jeff's letter—and  though Walt's letter is not extant he
agreed with Jeff that Jesse should be  institutionalized—Mattie was enlisted to submit
her opinion to Walt. Louisa's  standoffish phrasing in her December 25, 1863 letter—"i
told mat you would  have enoughf letter reading for to day in her letter it has been
long time com[ing?]  but has come at last"—may suggest that both Louisa's and Mattie's
letters were  enclosed in the same envelope but that Louisa was not permitted to read
Mattie's.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 25, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. If  Jeff intended that Mattie's letter would submit the dispute on what was to be
done  with Jesse to Walt's impartial judgment, Jeff was thwarted because Louisa had
no  intention of surrendering a second son so soon after Andrew's death—Louisa  would
not be crossed in the matter. Mattie explained that she was "a little annoyed  that
Jeff should have written you about Jess" and that before the December 4  incident
only Louisa had been the object of Jesse's previous threats—he would  "take up a chair
to throw at her." She concluded that whether to institutionalize  Jesse was ultimately
her mother-in-law's choice: "I dont think you could persuade her to send him."Martha Mitchell "Mattie" Whitman, December 21–23, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman (Randall
D. Waldron, ed. Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman [New York: New York University Press, 1977], 32–36). To Mattie, Louisa's determination to keep Jesse in the household was, for the moment,
the final word. Jeff and Louisa apparently settled their dispute, though no letter
mentions any explicit agreement: perhaps Jeff accepted his mother's preference to
keep Jesse, her eldest son, in the home but away from Jeff and his family's living
quarters, and Louisa accepted Jeff's preference to have nothing more to do with Nancy
and her children.

Walt had recommended institutionalizing Jesse and was responsible for doing so  in
December of the following year, but he in his known letters never advocated substantial
aid to Nancy and her children. Perhaps Walt too acquiesced to the opinion of his brother
Jeff, who had opposed extending aid to Nancy and her children before Andrew's death.
Jeff's letters from August to October 1863 signal his growing conviction that the
Whitmans could take on no more responsibility for Andrew's family. George, away at
war, was a notable exception  among the Whitman siblings: after he was notified of
his brother Andrew's death  George encouraged his mother to be generous toward Nancy
from his military pay.George Washington Whitman urged doing "all, that is required for, Andrews Family"
(December 9, 1863 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman). Whether the Whitman family continued to provide occasional aid to Nancy aside from
the handful of dollars that Walt forwarded during the next few years is uncertain,
but Nancy and her children after May 1864 otherwise dropped entirely from Whitman
family letters. George's letters have no mention of Nancy after his December 9, 1863
letter. Neither Nancy nor her children is mentioned once in Jeff's letters after December
1863, and she is not mentioned in Louisa's extant letters until summer 1867, a few
months after Jeff departed for St. Louis.

What can be constructed from Jeff's, Walt's, and George's letters suggests that 1864
was for Louisa the most taxing year, emotionally and physically, of the war. In  early
March, the Browns claimed to have renewed the lease of the Portland Avenue  home—which
had been purchased by a new owner—in their own name and  intended to increase the
monthly cost of the basement sublet to Louisa from $5  to $8. Jeff discovered that
the Browns had proposed the step to the landlord  but had not signed a new lease,
leading to a dispute that dragged on for at least a week or two during  which the
Whitmans were unsure whether they would be forced to move.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, March 11, 1864 letter to Walt Whitman. The  next week Jeff described his mother as "unwell for the last few days. She has
a very  steady and severe pain, she thinks a gathering or enlargement, in the right
side of  her chest. For a day or two she was almost helpless."Thomas Jefferson Whitman, March 19,  1864 letter to Walt Whitman. He blamed his mother's illness on  overexertion in housecleaning. Housing matters
probably receded from concern over the next several months as George's participation
in many significant battles of the war—North Anna in May, Cold Harbor in June, Battle
of the Crater in July—must have taken precedence. His capture during—and imprisonment
after—the Battle of Poplar Grove in September 1864 extended the Whitman family's worry.
No correspondence from Louisa is extant until just after George's release in February
the following year. The stress of George's letters from the front and his imprisonment
may have led the Whitman family, collectively, to inure themselves from the poverty
that Nancy and her children suffered, and the same stress may have contributed to
the decision to institutionalize Jesse in December.

In early 1865 George was released from prison, and by mid-year the war had ended.
Louisa in the late part of the year both sought to rescue daughter Hannah from her
abusive husband Charles Heyde, an effort that failed, and became increasingly  concerned
about crime in her Brooklyn neighborhood. She remarked vividly on such  concerns in
her letters to Walt, and she acknowledged that her effort to husband  George's military
pay for his own use after the war had left her in dire financial  condition. When
George arrived home after his release from Confederate prison camp,  Louisa conveyed
to Walt George's fear that he might not survive: a doctor "did what  he could for
him he had no medicine blistered him and gave him mercury he was  dilirious and lay
in A stupor till the night the fever turned he says he felt A  thrill run through
him and thought he was dying."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 5,  1865 letter to Walt Whitman. After his monthlong furlough in  Brooklyn, George's new assignment must have been
a relief: he served as a prison  officer in Maryland. When the war came to a close
and Lincoln was assassinated,  Louisa vented her disgust with British newspapers:
"the english papers is very  sypathectic for the honourable Jefferson davis poor mr
Lincoln s being murderd dont  seem to be any thing to them compared with the American
patriot as they call the great Jefferson davis)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 3, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman. During her September 1865 trip to Burlington, Vermont to assess the ongoing catastrophe
of her daughter Hannah's marriage to Charles Heyde—a trip she had planned as a rescueThomas Jefferson Whitman, July 16, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman.—Louisa became reconciled to their stormy relationship, or at least convinced herself
that it would be folly to intervene in their marriage.

After six weeks, she returned from Burlington to the domestic routine of caring for
growing granddaughters, where her anxieties about money began to merge with postwar
financial and social upheaval. She recognized that her thriftiness with George's military
pay during the war meant that her dependency on her sons had increased in the postwar
period: "i dont have much money to spend now adays to think i was such A fool as to
use all the money i had in the bank and save the other now i want it and wish i had
saved my own."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 3, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman. Criminal activity in public parks near the Navy Yard, presumably related to rising
unemployment during postwar demobilization, also raised her level of anxiety. A sensational
crime—a Spanish national from Cuba, who was said to have carried thousands of dollars
in cash, was attacked and murdered by two men wielding razors and a dagger—produced
a community-wide sensation, and a close neighbor on Portland Avenue had a watch stolen.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, November 25, 1865 and December 10, 1865 letters to Walt Whitman. The concern about crime in the near vicinity may have prompted the Whitmans' July
1866 move to a home on Prospect Park, then the outskirts of the city.

The new Pacific Street house, though more spacious, proved unpleasant for Louisa.
She  aired some of her complaints about housing discomforts and childcare frustrations
in  her letters to Walt, but she also discussed her reading, revealed some opinions
of  same-sex romantic partnerships, and explained her sense of poverty and dependency.
Louisa was unhappy with the move away from Brooklyn's city center—the  following spring
she noted, "I have lived in the country so long"Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 13, 1867 letter to Walt  Whitman.—and the Pacific Street house was exposed to the wind and  could not be warmed adequately.
Jeff's close friend and a former Brooklyn Water  Works engineer Joseph Phineas Davis,
who in 1866 began serving as the chief engineer  at the nearby Prospect Park, shared
the house with the Whitmans. Davis was a  sometimes exasperating housemate, but Louisa's
remark on his romantic partner  suggests that she saw little difference between male-female
or same-sex attraction.  Davis's frequent visitor elicited one remark: "he has a mr
somebody here quite  often to supper and stay all night)."Louisa Van  Velsor Whitman, June 7, 1866 letter to Walt  Whitman. But that was not a source of concern, or even interest: she was  instead exasperated
by Davis's habit of absconding with the New York Times, one of the newspapers in which she was following the  "speakery in the house." That
to her was a notable annoyance: "i generally see the  sunday paper davis takes the
times every day but he is so queer about it leaves it  over to the office."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,  June 7, 1866 and February 21, 1867 letters to Walt Whitman. Louisa's attitude toward Davis's "mr somebody" and same-sex romantic partners generally
was one of casual ease. She did tease family members about their romantic partners,
regardless of gender. Three years later, she gently teased Walt—"you must tell me
when you write how many valentines you got"Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 14 or 15, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman.—but she did not imply a gender designation for his Valentines. A year before she
mentioned Davis's companion, she mocked George's secretiveness about his new partner:
"he thinks he is very sly but murder will out."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 7, 1866 letter to Walt Whitman. Davis's unnamed partner received the gender designation "mr" and Louisa Orr is one
time called George's "gal,"Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 25, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. but Louisa's term "somebody," even if not invoking gender neutrality deliberately,
registered casual unconcern about the gender of a romantic or sexual partner.

Louisa was frustrated by childcare responsibilities but developed an enduring  tenderness
toward her granddaughter Manahatta "Hattie" and sometimes recognized humor in her
own difficulties. Though Louisa had called Hattie "very obstropolous" (a dialect form
of "obstreperous") when she was three, Louisa had grown close to her granddaughter
over the next four years.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 25 or October 2, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Following the death of a recently hatched chick, Hattie "buried one" and questioned
her grandmother: "she asked me if i thought it would go to heaven hattie is a very
smart child." Louisa in the same letter expressed irritation that Jeff and his wife
had been away to Philadelphia for an extended time. The household burdens—caring for
two children under eight years and for her son Edward, cooking for them as well as
for Davis and his cousin—fell entirely on Louisa: "martha has been gone to philadelphe
most a week Jeff came home last night but mat dident come they were to come tuesday
or wensday sure i dont think they will come such a game over me again she has no girl
and the work has been very hard on me."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 28, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. On another occasion, when Mattie and daughter Hattie were away, Louisa referred wryly
to the opportunity to write Walt as "A lull in the confusion."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 13, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman.

In early May 1867, the Pacific Street household was again "all in confusion" after
Jeff departed to St. Louis, where he had begun his work as chief engineer, a  position
in which he would rise to national prominence. Jeff and Mattie, unsure  whether Jeff's
departure from Brooklyn would be permanent, decided initially against  moving the
entire family. In part because Davis joined Jeff in St. Louis,  the remaining Whitmans
were compelled to depart the house, which  was apparently owned or managed by Prospect
Park, Davis's employer.  Mattie and daughters Hattie and Jessie Louisa planned to
stay in Towanda, Pennsylvania, with family friend Gordon F. Mason from spring into
the summer, so Louisa and Edward faced the urgent need to find  a new home.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, May 23, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. When the  Whitmans left, the new tenants included the brother-in-law of the Plymouth
Church pastor Beecher, and the arriving Bullards purchased some of the Whitmans' household
goods, including their chickens. Louisa's housing fears turned her thoughts to a small
lot with a carpenter shop that George's business partner, a man known only as "Smith,"
had purchased the previous year, on Putnam Avenue.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 2, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. After a few weeks of near panic, Louisa and Edward settled into a boarding house
on 1194 Atlantic Street. Walt, in a letter fragment that dates a few months after
Louisa's departure from the Pacific Street house, speculated at this time that he
could scrape together enough for George and his partner to build a small home for
his mother on the Putnam Avenue lot, but Smith's plan to build there eventually quashed
Louisa's best hope for a secure home.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 2, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman, October 18–30, 1867 letter fragment to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, which Edwin Haviland Miller dated October?
1866 (The Correspondence [New York: New York University Press, 1961–1977], 1:293). Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
October 16 or 23, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. 
   

   

Period 2: 1867–1872  

After Jeff's departure to St. Louis, Louisa endured an extended period of frustration
with housing, but the respite from childcare responsibilities allowed her to engage
more actively with Walt's literary career. She and Edward remained in the boarding
house on 1194 Atlantic Street for about a year, and they then moved to another boarding
house with a similar address, 1149 Atlantic Avenue. Though frustrated with boarding
house life at both locations—her wish to have a small place of her own brought the
still undeveloped Putnam Avenue lot often to mind—tepid post-war economic growth kept
George's housebuilding business in the doldrums and delayed Louisa's hoped-for home
over two years. It took until spring 1869 before George recovered his financial footing
both by selling several houses and by coming into his own as a favored pipe inspector.
Jeff and his friends and former Water Works engineers Moses Lane and Davis, now dispersed
as consultants and newly hired chief engineers in eastern and midwestern cities, relied
on the casting infrastructure in New Jersey and Pennsylvania to acquire their pipe—and
on George as an on-site inspector at the manufacturers. When George began to recover
financially in May 1869, he settled his mother and brother Edward in a home that he
had built at 71 Portland Avenue opposite the State Arsenal (also known as the Armory).

In spring 1871 George married Louisa Orr Haslam, whom he had courted and may have
intended to marry as early as 1866.Louisa Van  Velsor Whitman, June 7, 1866 letter to Walt  Whitman. With George having shifted his emphasis from housebuilding to  pipe inspection, he
moved to Camden, where he had better access to on-site  inspection work at the foundries.
George and his new wife soon began pressuring his  mother to relocate to Camden. Though
Louisa's health—especially  arthritis—made daily life more difficult physically, she
and Edward remained  in Brooklyn through summer 1872, when she acquiesced finally
to family pressure and  moved to Camden. This period of her life is richly documented
by her seventy-five  extant letters, which treat a range of family matters: Mattie
Whitman's declining  health; the amputation of daughter Hannah's thumb; George's business
matters;  Louisa's close involvement with the lives of her neighbors, other relatives,
and  Walt's many friends; Jesse's death; and the trials of Andrew's widow Nancy and
her children. The letters from this period provide ample evidence also of Louisa's
intellectual vibrancy.

That she was semi-literate and could not read or understand Walt's poetry is a canard
that her letters easily dispel: she read expansively in the news of her day, and thanks
largely to Walt's forwarded periodicals she achieved a substantial degree of print
culture sophistication. Newspapers that she read regularly or to which she subscribed
include the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, New York Times, New York Tribune, New York Sunday Mercury, New York Sun, and Brooklyn Daily Times. She referred to Walt's forwarded copies of the Illustrated Chicago News, the The Graphic (London), New York Daily Graphic, Washington Morning Chronicle, and a Star and a Sun, probably from Washington and Baltimore respectively. She appreciated engravings
in the Graphic, almost certainly one of two ambitious illustrations of dying soldiers during the
Franco-Prussian war—Henry Woods's "The Last Message" or Godefroy Durand's "The Last
Bivouac." The former depicts a setting with one soldier nursing his dying companion
that could almost accompany "Vigil Strange I Kept on the Field One Night" or "The
Wound-Dresser."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 9, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman. Walt regularly sent Louisa almanacs, including the Old Franklin Almanack, no. 9 (1867) and a Catholic almanac, and she acquired the Tribune Almanac and Political Register (1867) on her own. In March 1870 she asked Walt to "send the week," probably the
latest serial installment of an unnamed novel.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 23, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman. Like Walt, Louisa was an enthusiastic reader of George Sand, and she thanked him
for forwarding one of her novels in October 1871, and later the same month she thanked
him for Justin McCarthy's Lady Judith (1871).Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, October 7, 1871, October 23, 1871, and October 10, 1871 letters to Walt Whitman. She also praised Jean Bruce Washburn's Yo Semite: A Poem (1871).

Her daily reading of the Brooklyn Daily Eagle is almost as  important as family correspondence for dating her letters. She read
avidly the popular news of her city, but she read against the grain of the newspaper's
social and political commentary, most notably the political leanings that shaped the
paper's coverage of the impeachment of President Andrew Johnson and later the election
of Ulysses S. Grant. Aside from politics, she followed the newspaper sensations of
her day, which included a visit to Brooklyn by Queen Victoria's son Prince Arthur,
a Long Island railroad disaster in which one of the dead was named George Van Nostrand
(not her grandson by the same name as Walt had feared), the murder of a builder named
Dominicus S. Vorhees, and a train disaster known as the "Hudson River Horror." In
the last incident, a passenger train collided with derailed freight cars that had
been hauling some 500 barrels of kerosene: in the ensuing conflagration passengers
were burned alive and flaming cars tumbled off a bridge into the water.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 25–27, 1869, February 6, 1870, February 14 or 15, 1870, and February 9, 1871 letters to Walt Whitman.

Though Louisa read the Brooklyn Daily Eagle  faithfully—perhaps a habit that she had acquired in the mid-1840s when Walt  had
served as its editor—she regarded its Reconstruction-era political  coverage with
disdain. She deplored and even belittled the Democrat-leaning paper's  coverage of
the president: "the old eagle how i dislike it yet i take it if i dident  see any
other paper i should think andy was perfection and all the rest was crushed  general
grant in the bargain)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 17,  1868 letter to Walt Whitman. During the run-up toward the  impeachment of Johnson, Louisa read each day's news
eagerly and was impressed by the  speeches of Radical Republicans Thaddeus M. Stevens
and Benjamin F. Butler: "the last speech of stephens that was read before the impeachment
was good very indeed)"; "i never had any idea butler was so smart i suppose the others
is smart but he seems to fetch them up so quick)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 25, 1868 and April 7, 1868 letters to Walt Whitman. When the election approached, she mocked the Eagle's ludicrous claim that sensible Republicans in the state would support former New
York Governor Horatio Seymour rather than war hero Grant: "i wish you could see the
eagle it is worse than ever all the respectable radicals is in favor of seymore the
eagle says they are nearly all copperheads around here."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, July 15, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman.

For local news she mostly followed the Eagle but sometimes  picked up a copy of the New York Times or in lean periods  took a penny paper like the Sun. She read both national and  local news critically and recognized the casual misogyny
so common in the popular  press of her day. Shortly after Grant's election, the Times  lauded the Government Printing Office and Treasury Department. These federal offices
were dismissing female employees disproportionately—"the least efficient and  most
obnoxious, politically, of the employe[e]s"—among the clerks and other  personnel
in folding rooms and binderies."Washington: The Contest Between the Senate and the House on the  Tenure-of-Office
Bill—Great Reduction of the Clerical Force in the  Departments—Discharge of Female
Clerks," New York  Times, March 28, 1869, 1. Louisa saw the dismissals differently,  "i felt sorry to see so many females discharged."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 30,  1869 letter to Walt Whitman. She was also unsympathetic to the  stereotypically feminine enthusiasm for new fashions.
Her description of the new spring hats and bonnets for 1869—the former with narrow
brims that she despised, "i think the hats is awful"—was drawn not from the breathless
spring fashion reports but from a satiric Eagle correspondent named Corry O'Lanus.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 14, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman Louisa rarely commented on articles more than a few days old, so her remarks on articles
in periodicals, when they can be identified with a particular story, both illuminate
her political and cultural leanings and help to date her letters.

Louisa presumably shared the race bias and demeaning attitudes toward African  Americans
that are sprinkled throughout Whitman family letters, including Walt's,  but Louisa
did not use offensive terms for African Americans in her own letters.  Either or both
of Walt's two commonly noted but conflicting attitudes—his  toleration and even acceptance
of slavery as an institution in some of his prose  political commentary despite his
sympathy toward the slave's humanity in his  poetry—may have been shared by Louisa.
Her one mention of an African American stereotype, which is employed in  a Thomas
Nast cartoon in Harper's Weekly, is ambiguous  because her notice of it seems more characteristic of her pro-Republican
political leanings than her racial attitudes. Louisa had a "hearty  laughf " at the
Nast cartoon's portrayal of Salman P. Chase, the presidential  hopeful, as a physician
offering a "Sickly Democrat" a medicinal draught that  consists of a stereotyped black
figure, a satiric comment on Chase's doomed effort  to encourage the Democratic Party
to accept African American suffrage.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, July 8, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Thomas Nast,  "Sickly Democrat," Harper's Weekly, July 11, 1868, 439 (HarpWeek). Like Walt, she may have "internalized typical white racial attitudes of his time,
place, and class," or she may have shared the more progressive (for its era) attitude
known as romantic racialism, which historian George Fredrickson has noted was common
among antebellum antislavery and women's social reform circles.George Hutchinson and David Drews, "Racial Attitudes," Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia, ed. J. R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
Available http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_44.html. George M. Fredrickson, The Black Image in the White Mind: The Debate on Afro-American Character and Destiny,
1817–1914 (Middletown, Connecticut: Wesleyan University Press, 1987), 101–103. Louisa's remark on Nast's cartoon does not allow us to distinguish her views from
Walt's, so she may well have shared the antislavery bent of social reformers alongside
deeply seated racial prejudice that was characteristic of her generation. Into early
adulthood in New York she had of course witnessed slavery firsthand.

One prejudice, Louisa's attitude toward Native Americans, is readily discernible from
two letters: she shifted quickly from romantic idealization of disappearing Native
Americans (also Walt's attitude)Ed Folsom,  "Native Americans (Indians)," Walt  Whitman: An Encyclopedia, ed. J. R. LeMaster and Donald D. Kummings (New York: Garland Publishing, 1998).
Available http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_34.html.  toward her culture's shared horror after an incident known as the Modoc Massacre.
From one brief remark on Jean Washburn's Yo-Semite: A Poem  (1871)—"the old indian tradition i think is so beautifu[l?] ¶ the fire in  the woods
on the prairi[e?] is awful[l?] to rea[d?]"—we may reasonably  conclude that she shared
her culture's romanticization of a people that she assumed  had been relegated to
a superseded past.Louisa  Van Velsor Whitman, October 10, 1871 letter to  Walt Whitman. But when in early 1873 the Modoc tribe under its leader  Kientpoos (known by the
English name "Captain Jack") violently resisted a  peace negotiation party that aimed
to resettle the Modoc people in a reservation,  the form that resistance took was
beyond Louisa's imagining: "we saw  the news of the modoc massacre last sunday but
thought maybee it wasent true till we  got the herald."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 21–May 3?, 1873 letter to Walt  Whitman. The Herald's truth, that Modoc  warriors assassinated unarmed peace negotiators without cause,
was a racist  reduction: it ignored a long history of harassment against the Modoc
people by  Western settlers; internecine conflict among Modoc factions; the peace
negotiators'  plan to relocate the Modocs against their will in a reservation dominated
by the  Klamath people, their historical enemy; the military threat that backed up
the peace  negotiators; and the reasonable belief that for the federal peace commission
the  only satisfactory outcome to negotiation was Modoc removal, which would be achieved
with armed force if the peace commission failed. Louisa's racial prejudice against
Native American people was similar to Walt's, familiar to her times, and relatively
unambiguous in these two instances. 

We can from these two passages in Louisa's letters assume that her attitudes toward
Native Americans were similar to Walt's, but we should perhaps be more cautious in
any statements about her attitudes toward race or ethnicity. Her attitudes may have
shifted over time, evolved in response to particular incidents, or blended into fears
and desires for which she had limited means of expression within her own cultural
context. Louisa's ethnic prejudice toward the Irish is the only attitude voiced with
repeated virulence in her letters, and one root of that prejudice was Louisa's relationship
to her daughter-in-law Nancy, who was of Irish descent (see Andrew Jackson and Nancy
Whitman and children below). For Native Americans generally, the accord between Louisa's
letters and Walt's prose and letters allows us to surmise that she switched easily
between romantic idealization and racially inflected hatred, but our suppositions
are limited to the extant letters. Walt's attitudes about African Americans are more
complex when we contrast his prose and poetry, and Louisa's attitudes may in part
be reflected in Walt's "The Sleepers," a likely biographical passage about Louisa's
encounter with a "red squaw" that  has been identified as "the most extended treatment
of desire between women and also between races in all of Leaves of Grass."Moon and Sedgwick, 24–25. Walt's poem is thin evidence on which to reconstruct Louisa's desires as a young
woman—and we should acknowledge both that racial prejudice has been no barrier to
sexual desire and that verbal expressions of such desire in her era trespassed on
culturally forbidden terrain—but "The Sleepers" offers sufficient reason for caution
also when describing Louisa's attitudes toward Native Americans.

Louisa, like readers today, was capable of recognizing possibilities in Walt's poetic
voices, and the wealth of her comments on his poetry and on reviews of his work show
that her judgment could be incisive. She weighed the merits of William D. O'Connor's
"The Good Gray Poet" (1866) against John Burroughs' Notes on Walt Whitman, as Poet and Person (1867): "Walt doo you know i like his writings the good gray poet better than i doo
borroug[hs?] book Oconers shows the spirit its wrote in i should form an idea of the
man if i had never seen him by reading his writing."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 1, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. Roper credits the soundness of her judgment: O'Connor's essay "was a dense, allusion-studded
polemic of great power and stylistic brilliance, nigh unto an American rhetorical
tour de force."Roper, Now the Drum of War, 198. But she was no undiscriminating fan of O'Connor: his "Ballad of Sir Ball" she dismissed—"it
is signed w i hope nobody will think you wrote it walt)"—and she thought that O'Connor
failed to write to his full ability: "i dont see into his writing such peices as he
writes i should think him capable of writing something more substancial a man that
can converse as he can."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 24, 1868 and February 25, 1868 letters to Walt Whitman. Walt's essays and poetry she read closely and even affectionately: "well walter i
have the whis[p?]er[s?] of heavenly death it lays here on the table by my side i have
read it over many times […] i felt as if i should preserve it for i liked it it was
so solemn)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 31, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. She read the original appearances of Walt's articles in the Church brothers' Galaxy, which were revised for Democratic Vistas, and if her extant letters are representative, she received from Walt and read copies
of most known periodical appearances of his poetry. Louisa also recognized Anne Gilchrist's
"A Woman's Estimate of Walt Whitman" as an astute analysis of his work: "i set right
down and read it that Lady seems to understand your writing better than ever any one
did before as if she could see right through you she must be a highly educated woman."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 17–June 12, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman.

Louisa's comments and information on her neighbors and on family and friends during
this era are extensive. In the spring of 1868, Nancy McClure's sister-in-law contacted
Louisa about an effort to place Andrew's children in an orphan asylum. Louisa sought
Walt's assistance to coordinate the effort, but what actions he took are unknown,
and the effort came to naught.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 28–June 1, 1868. June 25, 1868 letters to Walt Whitman. Late 1868, when Mattie returned to Brooklyn for throat surgery—Jeff and children
arrived after several weeks—opened a period of significant strain for Louisa. From
just before Mattie's arrival through the start of 1869 Louisa witnessed an almost
unimaginable concentration of illness and death among relatives and neighbors. Nancy,
pregnant with twins, allowed her youngest son Andrew, Jr. (b. April 1864), to fend
for himself on Brooklyn streets, where he in September 1868 was struck by a brewery
wagon and killed.Walt Whitman, September 7, 1868 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. In November and December, at the time of Mattie's throat surgery, an infection on
daughter Hannah's hand led Dr. Samuel Thayer to lance her wrist and later to amputate
her thumb.For Mattie Whitman's health and Hannah Whitman's thumb, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
November 4–December 15, 1868 (eleven letters) to Walt Whitman. At 1149 Atlantic Avenue (to which Louisa had moved in September), Louisa cultivated
the friendship and shared the sufferings of neighbors Mary Mann and Margret Steers.
The former in November 1868 lost her four-year-old son Charley to the croup, and the
latter, a baker, lost her husband in early 1869 just weeks after her arrival at the
house in which Louisa boarded.For the death of Charlie Mann, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, November 2 or 3, 1868 and November 10, 1868 letters to Walt Whitman. For Margret Steers, Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 18, 1869 and April 25–27, 1869 letters to Walt Whitman. A year later in March 1870, Jesse, Louisa's "first born," died and was buried in
a pauper's grave at Brooklyn's Flatbush Insane Asylum.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 24, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman.

Louisa's emotional fortitude was strained and almost broken by her dependence on 
George for housing and financial assistance in late 1868, but the rapid turn of his
fortunes in early 1869 provided temporary respite and, for two brief years, a home
of her own. After banks clamped down on house lending in late 1868—which led  to stagnation
in house purchases into early 1869—George's business outlook was  bleak until Louisa
helped to coordinate a series of loans from Jeff and Walt, which  kept George's business
financially solvent into the summer.For Thomas Jefferson Whitman's loans to George, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 4, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. For Walt's loans to George, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,
March 15 and March 17, 1869 letters to Walt Whitman. For the agreement with Jeff as George understood it, see
Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 23, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. When the financial freeze eased in the spring, George designated a home for his mother
at 71 Portland Avenue and with the sale of homes began to repay rapidly the loans
to Jeff and Walt.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 25–27?, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. Even after Louisa had settled into the house that George had provided, Walt's lifeline
of two or three dollars with each letter, sometimes five or ten, and an occasional
money order for larger sums remained the means by which she held off the indignity
of asking George for money. Jeff and Mattie could not be relied on for financial relief—probably
because Mattie's worsening health absorbed their attention—but Jeff's substantial
income meant that their occasional gifts provided welcome respite from pinching need.
By spring 1871 George had relocated to Camden, New Jersey, and had married his longtime
somebody Louisa "Loo" Orr.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 19?–May 14?, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman. They began almost immediately to pressure Louisa to depart Brooklyn and join them:
"george and loo and Jeff insists on my breaking up houskeeping they dident only insist
but almost commanded me." Despite her own declining health, she suffered especially
from joint pain or  arthritis, Louisa resolved to stay in Brooklyn through another
winter, out of loyalty to her disabled son Edward: "none of them want edd."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, October 10, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman.   
   

   

Period 3: Fall 1872–May 1873  

Having faced down the pressure to depart Brooklyn the previous year, Louisa acquiesced
at the end of August 1872 and moved to Camden. Walt's offer to pay Edward's board
removed the last obstacle, and Louisa remained in Camden until her death in May 1873.
The promise of a private room and tender care soon proved an illusion: George and
Louisa Orr were distracted by other matters, and family sorrows multiplied rather
than abated. George's regular position as a Brooklyn pipe inspector evaporated in
late 1872, and in early 1873 he scrambled to claim a new short-term inspecting contract
for the city. After obtaining inspection work from Jeff's former Water Works coworkers
Mason and Davis a few months later, George was determined to build a new larger house.
His wife Louisa Orr had her own friends, shopping trips, and a briefly suspected pregnancy
to occupy her. In late 1872, Louisa's grandson, Nancy's son Georgy, died, and more
devastating news followed in early 1873. Walt suffered a debilitating paralytic stroke
in January, and Mattie Whitman died less than a month later. Though Louisa again indulged—with
Walt's prompting—the hope that she and Edward could join him in Washington and share
a small home, spring 1873 brought diminished physical strength, diminished dignity
in George's household, and, after a stroke-like episode in early May, diminished mental
acuity. Her ability to concentrate faltered, and an accompanying palsy made reading
and then writing impossible: all that remained was to bid farewell to her beloved
children.

The letters that fall between December 1872 to May 1873 received the least comprehensive
effort at dating by Whitman's executors, but the extraordinary number of extant letters
between mother and son—twenty-seven from Louisa, thirty-five from Walt—bespeak an
almost feverish devotion in their time of shared sorrow. In a remarkable sequence
after Walt's January 23 stroke, twenty-five of his next twenty-eight extant letters,
through April 6, are addressed to his mother. The nine newly dated letters from her
in this period provide a sympathetic but disturbing portrait of her last months. With
Walt's paralytic stroke, Mattie's death, the letters from Jeff's grieving daughter
Manahatta, George and Louisa Orr's bizarre hope to profit handsomely by taking in
Jeff's daughters, Louisa Orr's suspected pregnancy, and George's dedication to his
new house, the three months that preceded Louisa Whitman's early May 1873 stroke are
almost gothic in intensity and are a heartbreaking coda to her life.

The letters from this period deserve a more sympathetic reading because Miller in
the  Correspondence placed a withering emphasis on her complaints.  According to his annotations, Louisa
was "annoyed by George's economizing and, more  important, loath to accept a (rightful)
secondary position in her daughter-in-law's  household" and "complained to Helen Price";
Louisa "complained of her loneliness"; she "complained of her lot"; she "complained"
of George's stinginess; she "bitterly bewailed Louisa [Orr]'s economy"; and she also
"complained of dyspepsia."Miller, Correspondence, 2:200–201, n. 25; 2:205, n. 41; 2:206, n. 44; 2:212, n. 61; 2:215, n. 70; 2:217, n.
74. But readers of Louisa's letters should keep Ceniza's guidance in mind: she "had taken
care of grown children, sick children, dying children, and grandchildren for years.
She was old. She needed her own place in which to die."Ceniza, Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers, 29.

Until early 1873 Louisa continued to hold onto old habits from her Brooklyn years.
In  December 1872, she prepared a gift box for daughter Hannah and informed Walt that
George's plan to build a new house in Camden had to be postponed.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 3, 1872 letter to Walt Whitman. In mid-January Louisa again prepared a box for Hannah, but the tone of her letters
changed to devoted concern when she learned of Walt's stroke. She insisted that Walt
convey the truth about his health: "write just as you are walter ¶ dont say you are
better than you are."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, January 30, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. The next blow, Mattie's death on February 19, turned Louisa's thoughts to the desire
to provide comfort to her granddaughters: "i wish i had a home to take them for a
while." Thoughts of a home reminded her of Walt's condition as well: "i hope dear
walt you will have a home of your own some day if ever we want a home it is when we
are sick."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 27, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman.

Her letters turned often to houses also because George had purchased a lot on which
he planned to build, and Louisa's house thoughts were entwined with concern for Walt
and for her granddaughters. Though George had suffered brief periods of genuine  financial
worry in his housebuilding business, he was extraordinarily enterprising  and successful:
he weathered the cutbacks in Brooklyn inspecting work in 1871 and  1872, found a diverse
array of new inspection opportunities from former Water Works  engineers, and transitioned
smoothly out of housebuilding as his primary  occupation.On George Washington  Whitman's full slate of inspection jobs by early 1873, see Louisa
Van Velsor  Whitman, March 23, 1873 letter to Walt  Whitman. But his devotion to work raised in his mother Louisa immense  frustration after Mattie's
death. The new-house talk that dominated Camden conversation—which had occupied George
and Louisa Orr before Walt's stroke and became more urgent after Mattie's death—suggested
to them another possibility for extra income. They forced Louisa to write a letter
to Jeff with an offer to take in his daughters Manahatta and Jessie Louisa: "lou and
george wished me to write to jeff that they would take them i dident want to write
it but they insisted upon it i knew walt it wouldent doo of course but i wrote what
they wished) of course they expected jeff to pay a good board george thought lou could
manage them but walter dear it would never do."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 1, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. Louisa's grief over Mattie's death was deep and returned again to mind with each
letter from her granddaughter Manahatta. In one letter the bereft twelve-year old
enclosed "a rose that was on poor mammas coffin," and in another she wrote that "the
last few weeks seemed like a dream."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 4, 1873 and March 17, 1873 letters to Walt Whitman. Louisa, however, confined her grief for Mattie to her letters to Walt and to Jeff's
family because life in Camden returned quickly to the usual track. George and Louisa
Orr had shopping trips and the new house to plan, and Louisa, who was haunted by Mattie's
photograph, had no one to share her grief: "i seldom speak of her."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 17, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman.

Louisa's complaints about Louisa Orr became more strident after her daughter-in-law
stayed away in Philadelphia for almost a week, and Walt's hope that he could  purchase
a home encouraged Louisa to believe that that she might be able to escape  Camden.
During her daughter-in-law's absence Louisa struggled to cook for herself  but managed
with Edward's assistance: "i had a rather hard time of it i was so very  lame at times
i co[u?]ldent shut my hand my finger were so swoln but we got  along."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,  March 26–28?, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. When  Louisa Orr returned in late March, her suspected pregnancy forced Louisa out
of the  room that had been reserved for her, and she resumed the tasks of cooking
dinner,  baking pies, and washing dishes.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 26–28?,  1873 and April 3, 1873 letters to Walt  Whitman. George's new house began to take shape in early April, so Louisa  described the layout
and the expenditures in detail and also proposed a modest house  that she and Walt
could share. That a house would engage her mind, even as her body  was failing, is
understandable. Over two decades her adult life had been shaped  by the vagaries of
the speculative housebuilding business. Walt had encouraged the  fantasy in February—"if
you &amp; I had a house here"—and he returned to the thought in late March, "I shall surely get here or buy or build a little place here, rooms enough to live in for you &amp; Ed
and me."Walt Whitman, February 23, 1873 and March 28, 1873 letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Miller, Correspondence, 2:201, 208). The modest dwelling that Louisa imagined—two rooms above, two below, and a "shed
kitchen"—would if shared with both Walt and Edward have had little room to spare,
which prompted her to add a thought: "we couldent have many visitors to stay all night."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 8, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman.

Miller quoted that line and designated the last phrase "especially interesting."Miller, Correspondence, 2:209, n. 47. On what he bases that characterization is not clear, but her words could hardly signal
an obsessive desire to keep Walt to herself, a reasonable reading of Miller's phrase
that Ceniza has rejected.Ceniza, Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers, 29. Louisa recognized the limits of the house that she was imagining: it would be too
small for "many" overnight guests. In an almost exactly contemporary letter—of uncertain
date but within two weeks of her description of the possible house—she expressed her
appreciation for the two devoted companions who were nursing Walt after his paralytic
stroke: "give my love to mrs oconor and remember me to peter doyl."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 21–May 3?, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. To designate her house fantasy as an expression of possessiveness toward her son,
the delusion of a deteriorating mind, or perhaps as another sign of what Miller elsewhere
called her "egocentric indifference" is unfair: she was justifiably frustrated with
her living conditions.Miller, Walt Whitman's Poetry, 47. The private room and relief from household drudgery that the move to Camden had promised
were the fantasies that proved illusory.

On May 5 or 6, 1873, Louisa sent a letter that Walt acknowledged as the "short  letter,"
and the deterioration in her written hand suggests that she had suffered a  serious
episode, probably a stroke, which she described as "a trembling in my whole  system."
The next day, she instructed Walt, "dont send any more papers as i cant  read my head
gets confused."Louisa  Van Velsor Whitman, May 5 or 6, 1873 and May 6 or 7, 1873 letters to Walt Whitman. And then  for at least a week her letters to Walt stopped. On May 11, Walt wrote,
"I shall be  anxious to hear—write a line or two." On May 13, he almost begged, "try
to  write a line soon after you get this."Walt Whitman, May 11, 1873 and May 13, 1873 letters to Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman. When Louisa's next letter finally arrived—it had  been written on May 13 or 14—she
described to Walt another debilitating  episode: "my very brain has seemed to be affected."
And she allowed herself to share  the thinly concealed truth: "eddy is very good boy
lately he says he hopes i wont  die."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 13 or 14, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. This  letter may date a day before or after another letter, in which she described
"trembling spels its all my nerves" and was unambiguous about her limited  expectations
for her own future: "you must come on the 1 of the month."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 13 or 14, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman.

In these last letters, all after May 5, she adopted new forms to address her walter
dear: "darling walt," "dear blessed son," "dear beloved son," and, twice, "dear  beloved
walter." In her final letter, which may be a deathbed note that was never  sent, she
wrote that she has "lived beyond all comfort in this world."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 17–20, 1873 letter/note? to children. Shortly after her death, family friend Helen Price arrived in Camden, where she found
the poet "bent over his cane, both hands clasped upon it, and from time to time he
would lift it and bring it down with a heavy thud on the floor." Louisa Orr told Helen
that Walt had "sat there all through the previous night."Helen E. Price, "Reminiscences of Walt Whitman," ed. Joel Myerson, Whitman in His Own Time: A Biographical Chronicle of His Life, Drawn from Recollections,
Memoirs, and Interviews by Friends and Associates, expanded ed. (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2000), 282. Louisa's obituary in the Camden Democrat, written by walter dear, memorialized her as the "beloved mother of Walt Whitman.""Died," Camden Democrat, May 31, 1873, 3.   
  
   

   
Whitman Family  


Miller drew extensively from Louisa's letters for factual detail in the annotation
for the Correspondence, and subsequent editors of family correspondence—Jerome M. Loving, Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman (1975); Randall D. Waldron, Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman (1977); and Dennis Berthold and Kenneth M. Price, Dear Brother Walt: The Letters of Thomas Jefferson Whitman (1984)—have also used her letters to document family lives. Allen's Solitary Singer, still the most assiduously documented biography, and Roper's Now the Drum of War (2009), a family biography devoted mostly to the war years, also rely heavily on
Louisa's letters. The introductions to Loving's Civil War Letters and to Berthold and Price's Dear Brother Walt are accessible on the Whitman Archive, and the former should be consulted first for information about George and the latter
for Jeff and family. Because Loving also provides short portraits of Walt's other
siblings and their families, it is unnecessary here to again review them as independent
lives. This section instead emphasizes interdependence among family members and selected
details from Louisa's newly dated letters that correct, expand, or question previous
conclusions.


  

Andrew Jackson Whitman, Nancy, and Children  

Loving's introduction to the Civil War Letters of George Washington Whitman, which supplements  Katherine Molinoff's Some Notes on Whitman's Family (1941),  provides a systematic review of what was then known about Andrew, Nancy,
and her children. And Martin G. Murray's "Bunkum Did Go Sogering" later established
that Andrew did serve during the Civil War.Martin G. Murray, "Bunkum Did Go Sogering," Walt Whitman Quarterly Review 10 (Winter 1993), 142–148,  http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol10/iss3/4. Whitman biographers have noted Andrew's alcoholism, but many seem to share the Whitman
family's opinion that his wife Nancy, who engaged in prostitution, brought the evils
that she suffered upon herself. That is a fair reading of Louisa's opinion, but her
letters provide many clues that the Whitman family's unwillingness to support Nancy
or her children may have been associated with numerous factors: sympathy for alcoholism
among men that was not extended to women, the Whitman family's own financial strain
during the war, and anti-Irish prejudice. Whitman biographers may have concluded too
readily from Jeff's and Mattie's letters that Nancy deserved the suffering that she
endured. Louisa's concern about Nancy was greater than Walt's or Jeff's, but her sympathy
too was limited. A skeptical reading of the extant letters yields a more damning view
of the Whitman family's abandonment of Nancy and her children after Andrew's death,
but Louisa's late letters also show that the Whitman family did resume contact with
Nancy and that George and his wife Louisa Orr after their marriage in 1871 sought
out Nancy and attempted to rescue two of their surviving nephews.

The Whitman family disapproved strenuously of Nancy's drinking but accepted Andrew's,
and Louisa gave him money that she knew would be spent on extended drinking  binges—only
self-willed denial prevented her recognizing the latter.  Louisa in early 1863 drew
on George's military pay to help Andrew take a  doctor-recommended vacation to improve
his health, and in late August, after  recovering from an extended bout with pleurisy,
Andrew was inclined to again have  time away. He twice received money from Louisa,
$10 and $30, which he  promptly spent on two drinking sprees.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April  22–23, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. In a late August or  early September letter, Andrew's wife Nancy was blamed both
for causing him to drink  and rather implausibly for not managing the money that he
was wasting. The direct  aid that Louisa offered Nancy was meager: "Andrew had gone
and left her without any  money i gave her one dollar and one of my gowns and a quilt
petticoat" and "some  paper and envelopes and told her to write to him he had better
come home."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 31 or September 2, 1863 letter to Walt  Whitman. In Louisa's view Andrew's turn to alcohol was a consequence of Nancy's being a poor
household manager.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 25 or  October 2, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. According to Thomas Jefferson Whitman, his  sister-in-law
Nancy Whitman would be "able enough to make a good living both for  herself and the
children, if she wasnt so dam'd lazy" (September 24, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman). Andrew continued to collect his pay at the Navy Yard at least into late summer 1863,Thomas Jefferson Whitman, August 4, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. but a reader may well wonder, how could Nancy support herself or her children with
the money that Andrew was spending on drink? On this matter Louisa's letters are silent.

A specific reason that the Whitman family over the year 1863 became increasingly 
willing to abandon Nancy, pregnant with two young children, after Andrew's death 
cannot be associated with a single aspect of her personal character, but Jeff agreed
with Louisa's strong words, that Nancy was "dirty," "lazy," "ugly," a gossip, and
out on the streets.Louisa Van Velsor  Whitman, September 25 or October 2, 1863 and December 25, 1863 letters to Walt Whitman.  In late fall 1863, when Andrew's approaching death could no longer be denied, Jeff
became adamant that Nancy must take financial responsibility for herself. Jeff  rejected
assisting Nancy or her children because in his eyes the cause for their  poverty was
her laziness.Thomas  Jefferson Whitman, September 24, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Jeff's wife Mattie, a skilled seamstress, supplemented his income from the Water
Works with piece labor. After the Whitmans began assuming responsibility for Andrew's
food and medical care, they expected Nancy to maintain herself and her children with
sewing.

After Andrew's early December death, Mattie visited Nancy and realized that "a crust
of bread" was her only food. Mattie then sent her sister-in-law a chicken and "a large
basket of Provitions." Jeff visited Nancy later that day and apparently intended,
at  his wife's urging, to offer assistance; however, Jeff discovered that Andrew's
friends and co-workers from the Navy Yard had auctioned Andrew's carpentry tools and
would use the proceeds to purchase Nancy a sewing machine. Jeff decided then that
the charity he had planned to offer was no longer necessary, and Mattie's remark on
Nancy's future welfare seems to reflect a consensus that she and Jeff had reached:
"it seems as if the Lord always provides for the Widow and I feel confident that He
will provide for her."Mattie  Whitman, December 21, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman (Waldron, Mattie, 34–35). Jeff's last mention of Nancy  in his extant letters is from late-December: "Nancy
is abt the same as  ever—she seems to have no idea of getting along—she says she would
work  if she had it—but no idea of getting it. Mat has been trying to get her some
and I think will succeed in a few days."Thomas Jefferson Whitman, December 28, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman.

Jeff and Louisa accused Nancy of failures in housekeeping, personal hygiene, and 
childcare, and they associated her personal failings with her ethnic identity as an
Irish woman and, ultimately, with sexual license and prostitution. Whitman  biographer
Allen repeated Louisa's adjectives "dirty, ugly, and lazy" and referred to  Nancy's
"extravagance" and "misconduct," and subsequent biographers have accepted  Allen's
assessment.Allen, Solitary Singer, 304, 306, 308; Kaplan,  Walt Whitman, 293–295; Reynolds, Walt Whitman's  America, 409–410, 486. But even if Nancy was a poor  housekeeper in Louisa's and Mattie's eyes, the combination
of Andrew's drinking, the  loss of his income for her household after his illness
took hold, and pregnancy  rendered her and her sons Jimmy and George financially vulnerable.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, October 15, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Jeff's and Louisa's harsh opinion of Nancy was entwined with their prejudice against
Irish immigrants. During the New York draft riots Jeff gave full vent to his hatred:

 


I hear that [the Michigan Regiments] made fearful havoc with the irish ranks. Twas
better   so—they did not have that 'citizen feeling' that our militia would have had.
The   only feeling I have is that I fear that they did not kill enough of 'em Walt.
I'm   perfectly rabid on an Irishman I hate them worse than I thought I could hate
anything.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, July 19, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. 
 
 

Louisa's ethnic prejudice was not so visceral. Nonetheless, when she sought to remove
Nancy's children from her household in spring 1868, she took a moment in one letter
to explain to Walt, with a deliberateness that suggests some surprise, that Nancy's
brothers were "respectable men."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May? 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. In a similar moment of casual prejudice a few years later, Louisa mused that a benefit
of the Franco-Prussian War could be to inspire Irish immigrant ("Fenians") to depart
the country.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, July 20, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman. The term properly refers to the Fenian Brotherhood, an organization that promoted
Irish independence, but Louisa used it as a slur against working-class Irish immigrants.
Louisa's apparent acquiescence to Jeff and Mattie's preference to abandon Nancy and
her children to their fate in December 1863 was not final. Walt's letters provide
hints of occasional contact during next two years, and Louisa reconnected with Nancy
after Jeff's departure for St. Louis. But it seems most likely that Louisa after Andrew's
death devoted her emotional energies to resisting Jeff's desire to institutionalize
Jesse. Louisa suffered overwhelming physical and emotional strains during the war's
later years: caring for granddaughters, George's military service, caring for Edward,
heading off Jesse's potential violence, and sympathizing with Walt's heartbreaking
reports from Washington, D.C., hospitals—all from a cramped basement. And these strains
may well have left her with no emotional reserve to challenge the decision by Jeff
and Mattie—who struggled with many of the same burdens—to discontinue the aid that
the Whitman family had provided formerly to Nancy and her children.

Nothing is known of Nancy's life between January 1864 and early April of the same
year, when she gave birth to a son, as Louisa reported to Walt in a non-extant letter.
When Walt acknowledged the birth of Andrew, Jr., it may be telling that he attributed
the child's expected hardships to the general times rather than to a lack of aid from
the Whitman family: "So Nance has had another child, poor little one, there don't
seem to be much show for it, poor little young one, these times."Walt Whitman, April 5, 1864 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Jeff's December 1863 note on Nancy's job prospects and Walt's April acknowledgment
of the birth of Andrew, Jr., are the only substantive mentions of her or her family,
and until well after the war only a handful of Walt's letters—but not Jeff's, George's,
or Louisa's—have spare hints about Andrew's surviving family. Walt mentioned Nancy
three times after the birth of Andrew, Jr., through the year 1867: once to acknowledge
a letter from his mother that is "sad enough about Nancy, &amp; the young ones—is the
little baby still hearty, I believe you wrote a few weeks after it was born that it
was quite a fine child"; once to send a dollar in February 1865; and once to send
two more dollars to give to Nancy or spend on her behalf in December 1866.Walt Whitman, May 25, 1864, February 1, 1865, and December 24, 1866 letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. The comparative silence on Nancy's life in Whitman family letters may suggest that
she resorted to prostitution. She may also have scraped together a living from other
forms of labor, relied on her own siblings for support, or found other means of support
from a partner or charity. If she did turn to prostitution in a brutal late-war economy,
it was an understandable choice. Even were her difficulties not compounded by drinking,
her other known means to support herself and her children—sewing, the McClure or the
Whitman family's generosity, other assistance or work, and her children's begging—may
well have left her with insufficient resources to obtain basic necessities to sustain
life, such as housing, clothing, and food.

After Louisa settled in Atlantic Street in July 1867, two factors—the  departure of
Jeff and Mattie to St. Louis and Louisa's return to closer proximity to  the city
center—prompted her to seek out Nancy and her children. Even if  Louisa had maintained
occasional contact with Nancy, the absence of any mention of  her or Andrew's sons
in thirty letters from 1865 through July 1867 probably suggests  that they were no
longer regarded as a Whitman family concern. Nancy and her  children reappear in Louisa's
August 1867 letter, and Louisa's description suggests some period of lost contact
before Louisa with Edward's assistance had sought  them out: "Edd went down and found
where nancy lived yesterday she moved in the same st they are all fat edd says and
dirty but grow any how he said the house looked better than formerly i was glad to
hear from them i ha[ve?] thought about them often this hot weather."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 1, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman.

Louisa's continued concern for Andrew's family and the renewed contact in summer 1867
may have set in motion the next significant known episode, when in spring 1868  Louisa
joined an effort—at least with moral support—by Nancy's brother Edward and his wife
Janey McClure to have Nancy's children removed from her care and placed in an orphan
asylum. The spur for this renewed interest was that Nancy had given birth recently
to twins, one of whom died. On the basis of the two spring 1868 letters from Louisa
to Walt, Loving summarized the inconclusive episode. Whether or how Walt responded
after Louisa urged him to write a letter is not known. Loving remarked, "Whatever
became of Nancy after this time is uncertain."Loving, "Introduction," Civil War Letters, 13, http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May? 1868 and June 25, 1868 letters to Walt Whitman. However, Louisa's letters shed additional light: in October 1871, little George ("Georgy")
came to Louisa's door. At her daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's request, Louisa sent her
grandson away with a note requesting information about his brother Jimmy's birthday.
A few days later, a "strange boy" arrived with a letter and an offer from Nancy, that
Louisa could "take george if i wanted too." Louisa declined because she considered
Georgy "a very bad boy."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, October 23, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman. Nancy's willingness finally to surrender her two elder sons to the Whitman family—three
years after the deaths of her new-born twin infant and Andrew, Jr.—probably signaled
a decline into desperation. Only one letter from Louisa between October 1871 and December
1872 survives, but in that August 1872 letter, written just as she prepared to depart
for Camden, she revealed that Louisa Orr and George had taken in Nancy's eldest son
Jimmy—but not Georgy—in the interim since October 1871. Under their care, Jimmy's
"little pinched face is quite fatted up and he seems pleas[ed?] to be fixed up"; Louisa
began to hope that young George too could be rescued: "if we could only get Georgee
the[n?] in would be good)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, July 31 or August 7, 1872 letter to Walt Whitman. Whether Jimmy remained still in the care of Louisa Orr and George when Louisa arrived
in Camden is not known, and what is known about his later life is confined to the
handful of traces that Loving notes, but his brother Georgy presumably remained in
Brooklyn. Only one more trace of him appears in the Whitman family correspondence,
in Jeff's daughter Manahatta's letter to her grandmother in October of the same year:
"Mama told me how little Georgie got killed it was to bad."Manahatta Whitman, October 26, 1872 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.   
   

  

Mary and Ansel Van Nostrand and Children   

Louisa's elder daughter Mary and her husband Ansel Van Nostrand, whom she married
in 1840, lived on the far end of Long Island opposite Brooklyn, in the fishing village
of Greenport. They had five children: George, Fanny, Louisa, Ansel, Jr., and Mary
Isadore "Minnie." Molinoff described Mary and her family briefly in Some Notes on Whitman's Family, and Gohdes and Silver in Faint Clews &amp; Indirections printed two of Mary's letters and a short family sketch. Loving's introduction to
George Washington Whitman's Civil War Letters supersedes both.Molinoff, "Whitman's 'Dear Sister Mary,'" Some Notes on Whitman's Family (Brooklyn: Comet Press, 1941), 3–9. Gohdes and Silver, Faint Clews &amp; Indirections, 206–208. Loving, "Introduction," Civil War Letters, 10–11, http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html. However, three episodes in their lives that Louisa reported to Walt—the death of
Ansel's mother Fanny Van Nostrand, his severe bout with alcohol withdrawal, and the
marriage of daughter Minnie—can offer a corrected and somewhat rounder portrait of
the family.

Ansel's mother, called "Aunt Fanny," fell seriously ill in February 1868.See Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 25, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Gohdes and Silver assign the year 1867? to Mary Van Nostrand's
February 16 letter, but the correct year for Mary's letter is 1868 (Faint Clews &amp; Indirections, 206–207). After Fanny's death, Mary visited Louisa, and her talk was of the financial possibilities
that Fanny's estate opened for her family: "the means they have whether they have
the heart or not to use the means they talk of selling their place and buying one
up town further and one more stilish."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 24, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Mary's husband Ansel was an alcoholic, but Fanny's estate was apparently  substantial
enough that Louisa's daughter escaped significant financial hardship  and was able
even to indulge her youngest daughter Minnie. Several months after  his mother's death,
Ansel suffered severely—"come near dying" from "deliru  trem[es?]," that is, withdrawal-induced
delirium tremens—during a fishing  trip near the coast of Virginia after his son-in-law
John (Mary's daughter Louisa's  husband) had thrown his liquor overboard.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, October 19,  1869 letter to Walt Whitman. This incident or similar  behavior led to Ansel's demotion from a leadership position
that he had held formerly in a fraternal order.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman wrote "grand masonic lodge," but Ansel Van Nostrand was
probably a member of the International Order of Odd Fellows (May 28–June 1, 1868 letters to Walt Whitman). Two years later, in September 1871, Mary, her two daughters Louisa and Minnie, and
Ansel spent several days visiting Louisa in Brooklyn—they came to shop in preparation
for Minnie's approaching marriage to Leander Jay Young.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 28, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman. Perhaps Ansel stopped drinking after the summer 1869 incident, but the cluster of
letters that date before Minnie's marriage in fall 1871 show that Louisa's irritation
with Mary was for the family's use of her Brooklyn home as a home base for shopping
rather than a separation from Ansel: he accompanied his wife and two daughters to
Brooklyn.Loving's statement, that Mary "moved in with [Louisa]," is incorrect (Introduction,
Civil War Letters, 10, http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html). After the marriage in October, the newlyweds Minnie and Leander again visited Louisa
on their way to New York's St. Nicholas Hotel, which was then regarded as one of the
city's most ostentatious, a place for the "flashily-dressed, loud-voiced, and self-asserting."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, October 23, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman. James D. McCabe, Lights and Shadows of New York Life: or, the Sights and Sensations of the Great City (Philadelphia: National Publishing, 1872; digital reprint, 2012, Google Books), 306. Louisa's annoyance with the Van Nostrands may derive from some jealousy toward their
financial ease, which in her view they achieved almost effortlessly after Aunt Fanny's
death. Nonetheless, Louisa maintained an affection for her daughter Mary and when
frustrated by living with Louisa Orr wished that she could go to Greenport. The lasting
impression from Louisa's letters is that Mary devoted herself to her own growing brood
and that her children were dutiful toward but not exceedingly close to Louisa.    
   

  

Hannah and Charles L. Heyde  

While adding little to what is already known about Hannah's life, Louisa's letters
from her late 1865 visit to Vermont add vivid details about Burlington and her daughter's
relationship with Charles L. Heyde. Molinoff's Some Notes on Whitman's Family (1941), which reprints Hannah's obituary, provides many details about Hannah as an
elderly woman from the memory of her Burlington acquaintances, and the basic outline
of her life and marriage to landscape painter Heyde is provided in Loving's introduction
to the Civil War Letters. Some details are added by reviewing the selection of Hannah's letters in Gohdes
and Silver's Faint Clews &amp; Indirections.Katherine Molinoff, Some Notes on Whitman's Family, 24–43. Gohdes and Silver, Faint Clews &amp; Indirections, 209–212. Louisa's letters also offer additional context for what is known about the Whitman
family's relationship with Heyde and complicate an assertion about Louisa's gift packages,
which Ceniza has compared to Walt's poetry.

Louisa's September 1865 letters contrast her own life in Brooklyn and life in Burlington,
on the shore of Lake Champlain, but the respite in those letters from the usual details
about Heyde's mistreatment of her daughter Hannah is brief. Even during the first
week of Louisa's visit to Vermont the household tensions boiled over: "there was quite
a blow out of coarse i did not participate in the scrap."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 11, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman. However, two weeks later Louisa urged Walt to consider a summer home in Vermont:
she recounted the low prices for housing and foodstuffs, the wonders of the Pioneers'
Shops, and the glory of the R. W. Sherman steamboat.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 27, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman. After Louisa returned to Brooklyn, Hannah's health troubles and her son-in-law's
offensive letters came to be tolerated as an ongoing irritant. Upon receipt of a letter
from Hannah's husband in spring 1868, Louisa remarked on the artist's odd choice of
writing paper and cut him down to size, "three sheets of foolscap paper and a fool
wrote on them."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 24, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Through early 1873 Louisa continued to channel some of the funds from Walt and Jeff
to comfort Hannah with elaborate care packages: yards of cloth, preserved fruits,
candy, and other treats. Ceniza's claim that Louisa's gift packages for Hannah have
an affinity to Walt's poetry—"Whitman's poems were to him what Louisa's gift packages
were to her"—is accurate as an overall assessment.Ceniza, Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers, 10, 242, n. 1. However, the pervasiveness of gift packages to Hannah renders the mention of such
packets unreliable as guides to letter dates. Nonetheless, the letters of Charles
and Hannah may be the most promising area for new discoveries in—and corrections or
revisions to—Louisa's letters and Walt's expanded family biography.   
   

  

Thomas Jefferson Whitman, Martha Mitchell, and Children 

The lives of Jeff and his wife Mattie have been fully documented in the editions of
their complete letters. In both Price and Berthold's Dear Brother Walt and in Waldron's Mattie: The Letters of Martha Mitchell Whitman, the introductions, transcription of their letters, and annotations provide extensive
records of their lives. Because both of those editions draw from Louisa's letters
for their annotations, this edition offers few factual additions aside from somewhat
more reliable dating and details on their visits to Brooklyn (for which see the relevant
letters cited by Price and Berthold and Waldron). However, Louisa's letters do enrich
our understanding of the relationship between George, Jeff, and a Brooklyn Water Works
engineer Moses Lane. Furthermore, Louisa's letters shed additional light on the Whitmans'
relationship to the Brown family and on how Jeff's position at the Water Works was
instrumental to his brother George's eventual ability to transition from housebuilding
to full-time work as a pipe inspector at foundry sites in New Jersey.

The importance of maintaining social networks may have been a lesson to which the
Whitman sons looked to their mother for guidance. The Whitmans' relationship with
John Brown and family, with whom they shared the Portland Avenue home, has on the
basis of Jeff's letters appeared so toxic that one would hardly suspect that Louisa
maintained a friendship with and called on them. Louisa was frustrated after several
years in the same house: "I wish they were all gone."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 3, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman. But three years after moving out of Portland Avenue and less than two years after
Jeff's family departed for Missouri, Louisa called on Mrs. Brown, who "was very glad
indeed to see me got a nice dinner and made me stay i beleive its the first meal i
have eaten away from home since i come from Burlington if Jeff and matt knew i had
been to see mrs Brown they would cross me off their books."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 14, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. Louisa was returning a call that Mr. Brown had made in February 1868.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 19, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. For Jeff and Mattie—though of course the letters are incomplete—it appears that the
break with Nancy and her children and with the Browns were final. For Louisa, difficulties
and breaks in familial and personal relationships could always be mended, and she
had a long memory. Perhaps her reason for maintaining a connection with the Browns
dates from just after Andrew's death. She had written to Walt then: "one thing more
i must say mrs brown could not be kinder than she is i shall always respect her for
her great kindness in our affliction."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 4–5, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman.

Far more influential for George's future success was Jeff's ability to connect him
not to the family of a local Brooklyn tailor  like Brown but to link him to Lane and
other Water Works engineers, a process that Jeff initiated almost immediately at war's
end. Though George did not take up Lane's September 1865 offer for a position at the
Water Works, he eventually became an inspector of installed water mains, and his connection
to Lane helped George work through his financial difficulties in the housebuilding
business.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, September 11, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman.  Louisa's letters illuminate the intensity of the connections between Lane's family
and the Whitmans. George began inspecting pipe for the Water Works in 1867, and Louisa
twice in summer the following year reported Jeff's assurance that George's employment
would be stable: "george would not be discharged as long as mr Lane was there."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, July 8, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Also see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 25, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Lane's assistance to Walt's hospital work is well known, but even for that Louisa's
letters offer intriguing additions. Jeff had urged Walt to send a letter of thanks
to the children of several of his fellow engineers—the children themselves had raised
and contributed funds for the benefit of the soldiers—and one contributor was Lane's
daughter.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, June 4, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman. According to Louisa, Walt's letter of thanks to the four young girls led to an elaborate
choreography in which they each took a turn possessing the letter.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 3, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman.   

The Whitman's family connections to Lane were not sufficient to connect George permanently
to Water Works employment because Lane remained in Brooklyn only into spring 1869:
he resigned shortly after the New York Legislature reorganized the Water Board in
April with city-appointed commissioners, who replaced an appointed board that had
been shielded from local electioneering. One of the new commissioners, Thomas Kinsella,
conservative Democrat and longtime editor of the Daily Eagle, had pushed the board toward greater responsiveness to the interests of property
owners, and his new position on the oversight board added teeth to pronouncements
from his old editorial perch. No longer would an independent Water Board exercise
autonomous taxing authority and lay at the feet of property owners the cost of installing
water and sewage lines and contracting for the paving, cleaning, and lighting of streets.
The long-serving engineer Lane had no interest in adapting to the new dispensation,
so he resigned at the end of the month. George's position as an inspector for the
Water Works—though often by 1869 located not at the city installation sites but at
R. D. Wood Foundry sites in Camden and Millville, New Jersey, where he inspected newly
manufactured pipe—became tenuous.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 7, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. Louisa well understood that the new board, which prompted Lane's resignation, was
a threat to George's employment and thus to her own financial well-being.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 7, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. George continued with inspecting jobs for Brooklyn into late 1872, and Lane's departure
eventually proved a financial blessing to George because his personal connections
to the Whitman family remained strong. When Mattie visited Louisa in May 1870, Lane's
wife Marinda called on her in Louisa's home.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 16, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman. Marinda Lane was accompanied by Sarah Kirkwood, wife of James P. Kirkwood, an engineer
who had contributed also to Walt's hospital work, had proposed the original design
of the St. Louis Water Works, and had recommended Jeff to the position of chief engineer
there. After a brief period as a consultant in Chicago Lane was installed as the chief
engineer in Milwaukee. Once this dispersed network of engineers is understood—connected
to Jeff, Walt, Louisa, and George—it is easy to explain the origin of a statement
in Walt's January 1872 letter to his mother: "What do you hear from George—I kind
of hope he will not go to Milwaukee."Walt Whitman, January 23–24, 1872 to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. George's January 1872 opportunity in Milwaukee was from Lane: though George declined
that opportunity, the personal connection paid off financially in early 1873 when
George began to "oversee [Lane's] work" at New Jersey foundry sites in Florence and
Gloucester.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 23, 1873 to Walt Whitman.

Louisa's letters only hint at possibilities, but an analysis of the dispersal of Water
Works engineers and the records of the R. D. Wood Foundry might offer insight into
how social networks enabled upward mobility in a transforming post-war economy, at
least for those who by the fortune of gender, race, and ethnicity were not denied
access to these networks and to their eventual financial fruits."R. D. Wood &amp; Co. Records,1858–1910," Historical Society of Pennsylvania, http://hsp.org/sites/default/files/legacy_files/migrated/findingaid1176wood.pdf. Another Water Works employee who appears occasionally in Jeff's letters and often
in Louisa's, Samuel R. Probasco, took up employment as a pipe inspector after being
discharged from the Water Works in 1866. In 1867 Probasco suggested to George that
he coordinate his inspection work for Lane with nearby work for Jeff.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 23, 1866 and November 19, 1867 letters to Walt Whitman. See Roper, Now the Drum of War, 357. When George in late 1871 contacted Walt about inspection work for the city of Washington,
he assumed that his own wide network of connections to engineers who had known Jeff
and to former military officers employed in similar work—he named six men—might intersect
with Walt's connections in the federal government and secure for him the inspection
of the Washington pipe that would soon be cast at Star's Foundry.George Washington Whitman, September 6, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman, ed. Loving, Civil War Letters, 161. Walt's literary disciples are well known, but they may differ little in kind from
the network of Brooklyn engineers who contributed to Walt's hospital work. Jeff's
Water Works connections like Kirkwood, Lane, Davis, and Probasco by 1869 helped smooth
George's transition out of the housebuilding business. Such ties were also reinforced
by family friendship through Jeff's wife Mattie, Walt and Louisa, and these networks
allowed George to seize on financial opportunities when they arose. While it is true
that "It is not known how George Whitman accumulated so much money"—he had cash deposits
of $58,000 at his death in 1901Loving, "Introduction," Civil War Letters, 33, http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html.—his access to the network of Water Works engineers must have been an important factor.
George's tightfistedness, which Louisa often noted, may have contributed, but George
by dint of his own energy and adaptability was able to exploit the financial possibilities
that career networks offered and so to secure his rise from the working class into
comfortable middle-class life.   
   

  
George Washington and Louisa Orr   

George Washington Whitman's service during the Civil War has been documented and analyzed
with great thoroughness, in the annotations to Walt's letters to George in Miller's
Correspondence, in Loving's introduction, edited letters, and annotations, and, most recently and
at length in Roper's Now the Drum of War. The letters in Loving's edition are primary, but Roper's family biography—which
focuses as much or more upon George's service than upon Walt's hospital work and assesses
George's post-war business—includes several extended quotations from Louisa's letters.For quotations from many of Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters to Walt during the
war, see Roper, Now the Drum of War, 193–205. For George's housebuilding business, see 354–360. Because George's military service has been exhaustively studied, the remarks here
are confined to a note on the consequence of re-dated letters, which highlights the
near frenzy that long-delayed letters from George almost certainly induced in the
Whitmans' Brooklyn household. Some additional detail is added for the series of loans
that Jeff and Walt extended to George, for a small gift to Louisa from Jeff's wife
Mattie, and for George and Louisa Orr's marriage.

Indefinite and extended date ranges for letters obscure the fact that each  day's
delay before a letter was received would have provoked much worry.The discussion that follows is in debt  to Drew Gilpin Faust, This Republic of Suffering: Death and  the American Civil War (New York: Knopf, 2008). For example,  Miller dated Louisa's short note on George's July 23, 1863 letter "After
July 23(?)"  and Louisa's longer note on his August 16, 1863 letter to a range from
"August  16–25(?)."Miller, Correspondence, 1:373. If an indefinite range can be  narrowed—for example, mail from Kentucky to Brooklyn
took several days, so  July 23 is impossible for the first letter—the reassurance
that a letter's  arrival brought, were it received promptly, can be distinguished
from the mounting  worry if days or weeks passed before a letter was received. In
the aftermath even of  relatively small battles, newspaper lists of the dead and wounded
provoked  overwhelming anxiety. The faults of such lists are manifold: lack of thorough
accounting during the hurried assembly of names of dead and wounded, vague descriptions
of injuries, varying systems of shortened name forms, phonetic spellings, and typographic
errors.After the First Battle of Fredericksburg, George Washington Whitman's name appeared
in the "Times of day before yesterday" (Thomas Jefferson Whitman, December 19, 1862 letter to Walt). George's name also appeared in the December 16, 1862 issue of the Herald (Allen, Solitary Singer, 281). For major battles, even confidence that a son's or brother's name was not present
on a day's list could hardly be reassuring: supplements to the name lists every day
after major battles added to anxieties and fears, which could quickly reach fevered
pitch if days also passed with no letter.

The Whitmans' fear for George in summer 1863 must have been emotionally devastating:
Louisa did not receive George's July 23, 1863 letter for almost three weeks. She 
received it no earlier than August 13 and received no other letters from George in
the interim. Jeff on August 4 wrote, "we do not hear from George"; Walt on August
11  added, "I feel so anxious to hear from George, one cannot help feeling uneasy."Thomas Jefferson Whitman, August 4, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Walt Whitman, August 11, 1863 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. According to Miller, George Washington Whitman's
July 23, 1863 letter "evidently had not reached the family" when Walt wrote on August
11 (Correspondence, 1:130, n. 96). George's departure for the Ninth Corps' expedition from Kentucky to Mississippi delayed
the July 23 letter, and Louisa may have received it as late as August 17: the Whitman
family during the interim could only guess at his whereabouts or fate. Even when hopeful
that he was not in the heat of an engagement, every extended gap between letters was
excruciating because of other dangers: poor sanitation, not wounding in battle, was
the most frequent cause of death during the Civil War. Even the normally stoic George
recoiled from the toll of illness during the Ninth Corps' summer 1863 expedition to
Mississippi: the "deaths in some of the new regts was frightfull."George Washington Whitman, August 16, 1863 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. If we pay more careful attention to the likely date that Louisa received and then
forwarded a letter from George, it is impossible, as Miller suggested, that Walt acknowledged
George's August 16, 1863 letter with his of August 18. In fact, Walt on August 18
acknowledged receipt of George's July 23 letter. According to Louisa's note on George's
August 16 letter, she delayed forwarding that letter for several days.Miller, Correspondence, 1:136, n. 16. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 22–23, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Walt received the August 16 letter on August 25 and pronounced himself "glad indeed
to be certain that George had got back to Kentucky."Walt Whitman, August 25, 1863 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman.

When George returned from war, he used the money that Louisa had husbanded from his
earnings during the war to start his business. Beginning in late 1868, he began to
rely on loans from Jeff, and in early 1869 Louisa negotiated another set of loans
from both Walt and Jeff: the latter set of loans Jeff would eventually exchange for
a mortgage on one of the houses that George was building. The speculation on the 
dollar amounts of loans that George received from Jeff has been contradictory.  According
to Berthold and Price, who cite Miller's report from Louisa's letter, "In  exchange
for a mortgage, Jeff was paying George $3,000 in installments of  $200 per month.
George needed $600 immediately, however, to pay for a last  coat of plaster on his
own new house."Thomas Jefferson Whitman, March 25, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman (Berthold and Price, Dear Brother Walt, 136, n. 1, citing Miller, Correspondence, 2:79, n. 11). This was the plan as it was understood in late March 1869, and Walt did step up with
an immediate loan of slightly less to pay for the plaster, $500. However, according
to another analysis of a letter by Louisa, reported by Berthold and Price and cited
by Roper, "by June 23, 1869, George owed [Jeff] a total of $3,400."Thomas Jefferson Whitman, August 20, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. (Dear Brother Walt, 128, n. 1). Roper, Now the Drum of War, 358, 400, n. 38.

The source for the revised amount is the previously noted letter in which Louisa had
advised, "if you cant understand walter dear you must read it over two or three times)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 23, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. Louisa asked Walt to assist George and bore the task of tracking the various loans,
and she sought to manage the transactions such that Jeff, who at the time was far
more wealthy, would bear the greater financial burden. According to Louisa's June
23, 1869 letter, Jeff initially agreed to lend George $1,000 (two $500 payments) and
had agreed to lend an additional $3,000, or rather to purchase the mortgage on a house
that George was building for the latter sum, probably at the lot on Flatbush Avenue.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, August 20, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. However, after advancing $2,400 in monthly installments toward the $3,000 mortgage,
Jeff stopped making payments while still owing $600 toward the promised sum. Nonetheless,
Jeff asked George to repay the initial $1,000 immediately by selling a property that
Louisa's former neighbor Margret Steers planned to purchase. But George could not
sell that property because he no longer owned it: he had transferred that mortgage
to a mason to settle an outstanding debt. Jeff asked George not to sell the $3,000
property—the ownership of which Jeff claimed though according to the agreement $600
remained outstanding—and George apparently threw up his hands. The mortgage for the
home on Jeff's property sat at the title recorder's office awaiting an additional
$600 payment before it could be transferred. The reason that Jeff wanted George to
repay the $1,000 immediately was so that he could speculate on an iron furnace manufacturer.
The emphasis on dollar amounts may of course obscure a more significant point, that
two of the sons who were relying on their mother to help keep track of the complex
transactions were sometimes oblivious to her needs.

The matters of high finance between brothers, which have drawn significant scholarly
attention, were secondary in Louisa's life to a small remark that she made about an
enclosure from Jeff's wife in the same letter. Mattie, in her most recent letter,
had enclosed for Louisa a small gift, two shinplasters, fifty cents. Louisa's brief
remark on the gift—"quite a lift wasent it walt"—reveals her emotional state by its
stark contrast to the house investment opportunities, which are measured in dollars
by the thousands.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 23, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman.

Though Louisa complained often about George's stinginess, a critical reading suggests
that George and his new wife Louisa Orr were motivated often, if not always, by compassion.
Perhaps emblematic of the caution we should observe before judging them is that many
basic details about their life remain disputed. For example, the consensus of Whitman
scholars has been that George married Louisa Orr Haslam in April 1871, but it is somewhat
more likely that they married in March.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 7–May 15, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman. The newly married couple undertook a serious effort to aid Nancy's children, as noted
earlier, a choice that must have been motivated by compassion because Nancy was in
no position to pay them. But their desire to take in Jeff's daughters after Mattie's
death seemed, at least in Louisa's eyes, to be motivated more by self-interest. They
probably took on the task of caring for Louisa for her final year with compassionate
intent, but both George and Louisa Orr at moments of financial or emotional stress
were willing to take her household labor for granted. Their motives must have been
more complex than Louisa's letters allow them to seem, and Louisa may have had more
appreciation for their generosity had not her own sorrows and health difficulties
during her final months of life dominated her concerns.   
   

  
Jesse and Edward Whitman  
Louisa's letters add little to what has been reported in Whitman scholarship  about
Jesse, but they add enough detail about Edward, her disabled younger son  whose need
for care ensured that he would remain a constant presence in her  life, that the usual
emphasis on his epileptic fits, deformed limbs, and limited  mental capacity should
be reconsidered. Jesse returned to the Whitman household  between 1860 and 1863, and
he remained with Louisa until he was  institutionalized in late 1870. Roper's "Jesse
Whitman, Seafarer" (1993) is  definitive. He draws from Louisa's letters, documents
Jesse's life has a sailor,  and reviews the documents of his institutionalization.
Roper's account  supersedes Molinoff's brief notes and encompasses Loving's basic
review of  Jesse's life as well as Walt's niece Jessie Louisa Whitman's family account.
Only Genoways's recently discovered Whitman letter on Jesse's termination at the 
Naval Yard has added significant detail.Robert Roper, "Jesse Whitman Seafarer," Walt  Whitman Quarterly Review 26 (Summer 2008), 35–41, http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol26/iss1/4/.  Molinoff, Some Notes, 10–16. Randall Waldron,  "Jessie Louisa Whitman: Memories of Uncle Walt, et al.,
1939–1943,"  Walt Whitman Quarterly Review 7 (Summer 1989), 20,  http://dx.doi.org/10.13008/2153-3695.1231.  Ted Genoways, "Jesse Whitman in 1861: A New Letter," Walt  Whitman Quarterly Review 21 (Fall 2003), 96–97,  http://dx.doi.org/10.13008/2153-3695.1740.  A brief remark on Jesse's return to Brooklyn and his death are merited here; by
contrast, the demeaning simplification of Edward's life in family biography deserves
reconsideration.  

In two of her earliest known letters, from 1860, Louisa informed Walt that Jesse found
employment at the United States Navy Yard in Brooklyn and wished to return home. She
rejected Jesse's request as impractical: "Jess has got to work in the navy yard again
he was here last night and wanted to come home again I told him he would have to hire
board somewhere as I had hired out so much of the house I had no place for him to
sleep."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman,  March 31, 1860 and April 4, 1860  letters to Walt Whitman. When Jesse moved into the Portland Avenue home is not known—perhaps after he was
fired from the Navy Yard in late 1861—but Jesse was again living with his family by
February 1863, though it is unclear whether he contributed to rent or his own board.Walt Whitman, November 1861? letter (fragment) to Livingston Breese?, cited in Genoways,
"Jesse Whitman in 1861," 96. Thomas Jefferson Whitman, February 6, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 31–September 3, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. After Jesse was institutionalized in 1870, Louisa's letters have one remark on him
on the occasion when Tom Rome, who was also institutionalized, escaped from the Flatbush
Asylum: Jesse apparently declined to accompany Tom when he fled.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 7, 1869 letter to Walt Whitman. Roper, "Jesse Whitman, Seafarer," 37–38. Several weeks after Jesse's death on March 21, 1870, Louisa asked Walt to contact
the attending physician and learn more about his final days. She also lamented, just
after his death, that Jesse was buried in a "paupers grave."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 5, 1870 and March 24, 1870 letters to Walt Whitman.

Though Edward was a constant in Louisa's life, the scattered detail about him in letters
can only suggest caution about the undue emphasis in Whitman biography on his physical
and mental impairments. And the letters do allow us to adjudicate tentatively the
discrepancy between two portraits of Edward, the earlier one drawn by Molinoff and
the later one by the aged Jessie Louisa Whitman (Jeff and Mattie's daughter), who
offered a rejoinder to Whitman biographers. According to the portrait by Molinoff,
drawn from personal reports by Ulysses Goodenough, a member of the family in which
Edward boarded after his mother's death, Edward sat silently the entire day playing
with his dog Carlo, was teased by children, had to be prevented from devouring all
food before him, and would be found "just standing motionlessly and gazing at the
sky for several hours."Molinoff, Some Notes, 13. Hannah Severns, also interviewed by Molinoff, recalled that Edward "had a fiery temper."Molinoff, Some Notes, 12, n. 19. Quoted in Loving, Civil War Letters, 16, http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html. Loving, whose portrait of Edward relies heavily on Molinoff's sketch, highlights
Jeff's desire to place Edward in an asylum after Jesse's outburst. The Edward from
late in his life that predominates in Molinoff's sketch should not be juxtaposed with
the Edward in Brooklyn from more than two decades earlier. Jeff only recommended institutionalizing
Edward when he was in high agitation about Jesse's recent outburst—Jeff in the same
letter indicated that he might have shot Jesse. And Jeff did not imply that Edward
would need to be institutionalized immediately. Loving's suggestion that Edward was
a possible threat to his mother—"never presented as much danger to his mother as her
eldest son"—is not borne out by any of her letters, nor Jeff's letters. Jeff proposed
placing his brother in an asylum because he thought Edward a burden that neither he
nor Walt would be willing to bear after Louisa's death.Thomas Jefferson Whitman, December 15, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Loving, "Introduction," Civil War Letters, 15, http://www.whitmanarchive.org/biography/correspondence/cw/tei/anc.02057.html.

According to the recollection of Edward's niece Jessie Louisa, Whitman biographers
were unfair to Edward. She recalled that Edward was entrusted to take her and her
older sister Manahatta "on long afternoon excursions in a pushcart" without other
supervision or any concern should they be away for an extended period.Waldron, "Jessie Louisa Whitman," 20. The Edward that Jessie Louisa remembered from her childhood may have been far more
capable than the man from two decades later, whose epileptic seizures could by then
have contributed to significant brain degeneration. When Jessie Louisa knew Edward
best, he was in his early and mid-thirties. Goodenough recalled Louisa's son from
the late 1880s when Edward was in his late forties and early fifties. Two decades
is a significant span in the life of any person, and epileptic seizures may have led
to even more marked differences than typical in Edward's case.

One cannot discount entirely the possibility that Edward represented a threat of some
physical violence to children, as reported by Molinoff, but the physical degeneration
in his later years probably meant that restricted movements of his limbs rendered
him no serious threat to those who might tease or harass him. Regardless, Louisa's
letters provide no hint that he ever represented a threat to his mother and abundant
evidence that she relied on him for much. Edward was a faithful parishioner at Beecher's
Plymouth Church, which was at a remove of at least several blocks from the Whitmans'
various Brooklyn homes. And Edward had to be fairly independent to travel on his own
to locate Nancy and her children in 1867. Moreover, as noted earlier, Louisa apparently
teased Edward and derived some entertainment from his rising frustration after his
encounter with the Democrat. If Edward was capable of being roused to frustration
when teased about presidential politics, he must have been sufficiently aware of the
impeachment of Andrew Johnson—a subject of table talk between his mother and brother
George—to become emotionally engaged in the outcome. The repeated emphasis on Molinoff's
reported details about Edward's life—epileptic fits, mindless devouring of food, and
deformed limbs—may be apt for his later years but are probably inaccurate for the
earlier period. Of course, Jessie Louisa's remarks may be colored by fond reflection
and a desire to defend her family. Though Louisa's letters offer too little detail
for us to construct Edward's inner life, they do provide a reasonably strong suggestion
that his life, like his mother's, had a greater variety of tonal nuance than Whitman
scholarship has previously conveyed.   
  
   

  

Louisa and Walt 
When Walt in his August 1888 conversation with Traubel declared his mother "illiterate
in the formal sense," her temperament—as revealed by his Civil War letters to her—was
rendered a function of her relationship to him, as a mother absorbed into and reflected
through his own words. But even Walt cannot control his own legacy completely, and
Louisa's letters at the time of publication will be represented more comprehensively
in digital form on the Whitman Archive than Walt's own. The full range of her letters exert their own gravity: they move
the center of orbit in family correspondence from Walt to his mother, they highlight
her wide range of social interactions and her verbal inventiveness in spite of the
grating burden of financial dependency, they illuminate some familiar phrases in Walt's
poetry and correspondence, and they may invite scholars to reconsider the impetus
for Walt's first post-Civil War revision to Leaves of Grass. 

Walt's mother is his most significant correspondent by general acclamation and his
most frequent by a decisive margin. Two of the earliest editions of his selected letters
consist entirely of his letters to his mother during and after the Civil War, The Wound Dresser (1897) and Walt Whitman's Letters to His Mother, 1866–1872 (1936). The present count of Walt's extant letters from his earliest known through
his mother's death in May 1873 is 570.For a list of 567 known letters, see Ted Genoways, ed. "Calendar of Letters," Walt Whitman: The Correspondence (Iowa City: University of Iowa Press, 2004), 7:123–139. To reach 570, I add three
subsequent letters reported by Ed Folsom ("Three Unpublished Whitman Letters to Harry
Stafford and a Specimen Days Prose Fragment," Walt Whitman Quarterly Review 25 [Spring 2008], 197–200, http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol25/iss4/5). For possibly an additional letter fragment, see Kenneth M. Price, "Tolerance and
Elimination in Whitman's 'land of all ideas': A Complex Prose Manuscript and a Previously
Unknown Letter Fragment," Walt Whitman Quarterly Review 27 (Summer/Fall 2009), 66–71, http://ir.uiowa.edu/wwqr/vol27/iss1/5/. Walt addressed his mother in 159 of the letters, just below twenty-eight percent.
His extant letters to other family members during his mother's lifetime are small
in number by comparison: thirteen to Jeff and four to George. In fact, Walt's letters
to correspondents outside his family (again, though May 1873) far exceed in number
those to any family member: forty-five to Peter Doyle, thirty-nine to Ellen M. and
William D. O'Connor, and eighteen to Abby H. Price.

Our sense of Walt's correspondence is of course shaped by the historical accident
of the letters that happen to be preserved and are now known to scholars, but Walt's
dedication to collecting his mother's letters helped to ensure their preservation.
During the war, Louisa's letters from Brooklyn connected Walt in Washington, daughter
Mary and family in Greenport at the opposite end of Long Island, daughter Hannah Louisa
and husband Charles Heyde in Vermont, and son George during his deployment throughout
various theaters of the conflict. Beginning in 1868, Jeff and wife Mattie in St. Louis
became another instance of far-flung family that Louisa's correspondence sought to
keep connected. Louisa's letters many times were sent with an enclosed letter from
another family member or (if not) a quote or paraphrase from a letter in her own words.
Only after March 1873, when Louisa suffered her serious decline in health, would the
energy that she had devoted to maintaining family connections through her letters
wane.

The merit of Louisa's letters—aside from their biographical information about Walt
and their clues to "familiar usages" that inspired him—is that they are a rare extended
record of the life of a working-class woman during the Civil War and Reconstruction.
The letters exhibit the emotional and social burdens of limited education, spousal
mistreatment, and the ever-present concerns of uncertain housing and poverty. But
they are not the litany of bitterness and woe that Miller emphasized in the Correspondence: she was immersed in the periodical culture of her day, displayed a remarkable ability
to maintain social networks, sought to sustain others in times of hardship and trial,
showed remarkable resilience in managing her own burdens, and had a genuinely engaging
personality.

The latter two qualities permitted her to move with ease in a wide variety of social
circles: the breadth of these connections almost by themselves dispels the suspicion
that she was a psychological burden on her son. She was at ease upon meeting Walt's
literary acquaintances Thoreau and Alcott, and she welcomed Walt's friends and disciples,
the O'Connors and Burroughs, into her home. Jeff's engineering peers Moses Lane and
Joseph Phineas Davis were her friends as well. Abby Price, her daughters Helen and
Emily, and Ellen M. O'Connor were friends to Louisa as well as to Walt. Louisa  was
Walt's source for details about extended family in rural Long Island, and she enjoyed
an array of other Brooklyn friends and acquaintances that she had built up over four
decades of life in the city. The new availability of digital resources—census records,
city directories, and the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, for example—have contributed to the annotation of these neighbors and friends and
will enable scholars to study in greater depth her acquaintances outside those who
have gained renown largely through their connection to her son.

Louisa's unorthodox punctuation should not distract attention from a more notable
quality, her sharp attention to common and familiar verbal forms that she and Walt
shared to describe the passage from day to day—and her recognition of the  poet's
ability to see the everyday with fresh eyes. For both Louisa and Walt one of  the
most frequent phrases in their letters is "about the same," but she read even  Walt's
most familiar phrases with care. After his January 1873 stroke, he promised  to share
his condition faithfully, "the exact truth—neither  better nor worse."Walt Whitman, January 26, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Miller, Correspondence, 2:192). Louisa demanded no less: "write just as you are walter ¶ dont say you are better
than you are."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, January 30, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. Yet in late April Walt resorted to the familiar phrase to describe his condition,
"I am about the same."Walt Whitman, April 30, 1873 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman (Miller, Correspondence, 2:217). Despite her own failing health, Louisa was unsatisfied with her son's shorthand:
"you dident write how you was particularly that you was abou[t?] the same."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, April 21–May 3, 1873 letter to Walt Whitman. Though she may not have responded to that letter—the date can only be established
as a range, and she may have caught Walt's earlier attempt to pass over details—she
was aware of his unusual power of observation and for his own health would accept
no less. Walt's phrase "I sit and look out" is so characteristic in his journalism
that Emory Holloway and Vernolian Schwarz chose it as their title for a selection
of his writings from the Brooklyn Daily Times.Walt Whitman, I Sit and Look Out: Editorials from the Brooklyn Daily Times, ed. Emory Holloway and Vernolian Schwarz (New York: Columbia University Press, 1932). In 1863, after Walt moved to 456 Sixth Street West near Pennsylvania Avenue, where
he had boarded with Eliza S. Baker, he wrote to his mother of his confidence that
it would be "a very good winter room, as it is right under the roof &amp; looks south,
has low windows, is plenty big enough."Walt Whitman, October 20, 1863 letter to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Louisa recognized immediately the quality of his insight: "you must write next week
all about your new quarters how you like your room that fronts the south i shouldent
have thought any thing about its fronting the north or south)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, October 26, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman.

Louisa's letters are reminders that Walt's eminent place among poets results in part
from his ability to discern the poetic in the familiar. In June 1867 Louisa wrote
to Walt that his brother George had leg pains, which were aggravated by much walking:
"he was here to breakfast this morning but felt as if he would like to loaf and live
at his ease."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, June 20, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. Her phrase recalls one of the most famous lines in her son's poetry, "I lean and
loafe at my ease" (1855). But whether she echoed Walt's poem, later to be titled "Song
of Myself," or the poem's line is his inverted echo of her familial expression cannot
be determined. If the former, it is she who absorbed the language of Walt's poetry,
made familiar by her reading, into herself.  

Of greater historical interest is her remark to Walt about Leaves of Grass during a period in which his activities are thinly documented from his letters. In
her February 12, 1868 letter, probably in response to a lost letter from Walt that
dates February 10 or 11, 1868, Louisa closed with a brief remark: "so your writin[g?]
again leaves of grass well if it dont hurt you i am glad."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 12, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Cf., Walt Whitman, February 9?, 1868 letter to Louisa Van
Velsor Whitman (Miller, "A Checklist of Whitman's Lost Letters," Correspondence, 2:360). The presence of this phrase has been noted, but the general uncertainty about the
dates of her letters may have allowed one potential significance of the date to escape
attention.Ceniza,Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers, 22. Furness, 426–427. If Walt informed Louisa that he was working on Leaves of Grass in February 1868, he had begun the revision that would lead to the fifth American
edition (1871–72). If so, the date that he began revising that edition would conflict
with present scholarly consensus, that he took up the fifth edition "as early as summer
1869."Luke Mancuso, "Leaves of Grass, 1871–1872 Edition," Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia, ed. LeMaster and Kummings. Available http://whitmanarchive.org/criticism/current/encyclopedia/entry_25.html. That Walt began his revision earlier is also suggested in his October 9, 1868 letter
to Peter Doyle, that he intended to soon have the "new &amp; improved edition set up &amp;
stereotyped, which it is my present plan to do the ensuing winter at my leisure in
Washington."Walt Whitman, October 9, 1868 letter to Peter Doyle. It bears more investigation whether Walt's revisions for the 1870 edition were well
in progress in early and mid-1868. If he began revising for the fifth edition over
a year earlier than thought, his correspondence concerning William Michael Rossetti's
expurgated London edition, Poems by Walt Whitman (Hotten, 1868), may have played a more significant role in prompting his return to
his book of poems, and perhaps in informing his revision of it. Poems by Walt Whitman. Selected and Edited by William Michael Rossetti (London: Hotten, 1868). Available http://www.whitmanarchive.org/published/foreign/british/index.html.

Louisa's letters, though they shed light on Walt's poetry, are more often revealing
about the unpleasant aspects of day-to-day tasks like housecleaning and childcare,
which remained Louisa's burden but evoked Walt's sympathy. Perhaps most telling among
the tasks that Louisa took upon herself—because it needed to be done—was to monitor
the passing of a penny after her granddaughter Jessie Louisa "Sis" swallowed it. In
March 1867, Sis was not yet four, but her mother Mattie was too occupied with other
matters to be concerned about the penny.  

 
 

i hope when she comes back she will settle down and be  a little like herself i hardly
see her she s so engag[ed?] in company and dress  you know i wrote about sis swallowing
the peny the next day morning matty and her friend went out so i kept sis and wached
her and the penny passed through her when her mother came home she never asked any
thing abou[t?] it so i wouldent tell herLouisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 21, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman. For the initial report, see her March 15, 1867 letter to Walt. 
 
   

Walt, who from his hospital work understood well the tasks of personal care, which
for Louisa at this moment was the careful examination of her granddaughter's excrement,
gently turned his mother's attention from the unpleasantness of the act and from her
frustration with her daughter-in-law Mattie. To the first report on the penny he responded
with eager concern, in his letter's opening paragraph: "I want to hear whether sis
got over swallowing the penny—don't forget to write about it." To the second letter
on the topic he responded with gratitude, again in the opening paragraph of his letter:
"I was glad to hear that sis's penny had a safe journey."Walt Whitman, March 19, 1867 and March 26, 1867 letters to Louisa Van Velsor Whitman. Walt emphasized the ethics of care and struck a remarkably conciliatory note that
is leavened with humor. Walt's words could not undo what Louisa's clear sense of her
own assigned responsibility underlined about her place in the household, but his words
mark generous concern for the burdens that she bore.

As this introduction began with letters of complaint that Louisa wished would be burned,
it is fitting to close with the dominant sentiment in her letters, gratitude for the
gifts of money, paper, envelopes, books, and sundries. When reading Walt's letters
without his mother's replies, one may easily pass over his occasional enclosure of
small gifts. In many cases, he neglected even to mention them, which renders them
invisible in the edited correspondence. Upon reading Louisa's letters, one realizes
soon that these small gifts were not occasional enclosures but consistent and essential
sustenance that Walt sent with almost every letter, a generosity that taxed Louisa's
verbal ingenuity and that make her letters today a litany of inventive formulas of
thanks. Here follows a representative sample: "i have received your letter with 3
dollars"; "i have just receeved your favor as the business men say enclosing 3 doller";
"thanks for your remembrance"; "got your letter with the ten dollars and am very much
Obliged to you"; "just got your letter with the order and am much Obliged and it comes
very acceptable"; "with many thanks for money and books"; "got your letter to day
tuesday with the money all safe am Obliged to you for it"; "O walt i am so thankful
to you for your kindness to me in sending me money at all times"; "i suppose you have
got my letter i wrote last saturday as soon as i received yours with the money"; "i
received your letter to day walt its a great consolation to get your letters nearly
all the comfort i have) as i have no one to talk too about any of my own"; "i have
just receeved your letter this stormy morning with the dollar in sometimes i want
a little change but dont send it only once in a while)."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 23, 1866, June 7, 1866, January 27, 1867, December 15, 1867, November 30–December 3, 1868, December 28, 1868, January 19, 1869, October 7, 1871, March 4, 1873, April 5, 1873, and April 10–15, 1873 letters to Walt Whitman. The small gifts that Walt enclosed helped his mother to maintain a semblance of personal
dignity, one which biographical readings like Ceniza's and Roper's have restored,
one which this edition of letters seeks to preserve.

In an 1891 letter to his sister Hannah, Walt explained the purpose of the mausoleum
that he was constructing near Camden: "it is my design to gather the remains of our
dear mother &amp; father and &amp; have them buried there too in the tomb that I have had
built for myself."Walt Whitman, September 8, 1891 letter to Hannah Heyde (Genoways, Correspondence, 7:240). Walt's wishes were fulfilled, and the mausoleum now holds also the remains of his
mother Louisa, father Walter, Sr., sister Hannah, brother George and wife Louisa Orr,
and their infant son. Justin Kaplan observes that his mausoleum "in a lasting assertion
of self, merged their identities into his; the pediment of his mausoleum bore only
one name, 'Walt Whitman.' "Kaplan, Walt Whitman, 50. The digital archive that bears the poet's name now encompasses another, his mother
Louisa, whose letters may best serve those readers who heed his great poem, and who,
upon failing to fetch him at first, should keep encouraged, who missing him in one
place should search another. 

  

  

Editorial Introduction   



Each of the 170 letters in this edition is represented by high-resolution digital
images, an authoritative transcription, and full annotation. Twenty-seven of the letters
have not been listed previously in editions of Whitman's correspondence. This edition
follows the practice set down by Miller and Genoways and continued by the Whitman Archive, to err on the side of comprehensiveness by designating as correspondence even brief
items such as postcard acknowledgments, draft or incomplete letters, or notes on forwarded
letters. In the case of Louisa's letters, two of hers to Walt consist of a brief note
on a forwarded letter from George during the Civil War. Three more brief items during
the month of her death include a two-line "short letter," a one-line postscript to
daughter-in-law Louisa Orr's letter, and a one-line deathbed note, which may not have
been sent by mail because Walt had already arrived in Camden.

The practice of this edition in the matters of scope, dating, transcription, and annotation
is in debt to previous scholars. This edition both honors and builds on the practice
of previous work, conforms to the wider practice of the Whitman Archive, and, when deemed necessary by the editor, adopts alternate methods. Some modifications
of common editorial practices are demanded by the qualities of these letters as material
documents, and other modifications are demanded by the characteristics of digital-only
publication in the context of the Whitman Archive, where these letters will likely be first encountered as individual documents.


  

Scope   

Of the 170 letters in this edition 144 are drawn from two manuscript letter books
held in the Trent Collection of Whitmaniana at the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp;
Manuscript Library at Duke University. The letters are held in two bound volumes entitled
Walt Whitman: An Extensive Collection of Holograph Letters by His Mother Mrs. L. Whitman
(Louisa Van Velsor, 1795-1873.): […] Vol. I: 1860–1868 and Vol. II: 1868–1873, hereafter Extensive Collection (Vol. 1 or Vol. 2).The full title of An Extensive Collection includes a scope or contents statement, as follows: comprising 3 Letters written to him in 1860 while he was away in Boston seeing to
the Publication of the 1860 Edition of "Leaves of Grass" and a series of 141 Letters
written to him at Washington during the years 1863–73, when he was engaged on Hospital
work during the Secession War and as a Government Clerk. According to Will Hansen, Assistant Curator of Collections at the Rubenstein Library,
the manuscript letters from Louisa were originally in the possession of Whitman executor
Richard Maurice Bucke. An unknown collector, who purchased the letters after Bucke's
collection was dispersed, had typed transcriptions prepared and mounted the letters
with typescripts in the two Extensive Collection volumes that were acquired by Josiah C. Trent. The remaining letters in the Trent
Collection, four of them, are written on the surface of letters from a bound volume
of George Washington Whitman's Civil War letters.

The second largest set of letters, formerly in the T. E. Hanley Collection, is now
part of the Walt Whitman Collection at the Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center,
University of Texas. Thirteen letters from Louisa to Walt are bound, also with typescripts,
in a volume entitled Walt Whitman: A Series of Thirteen Letters from His Mother to Her Son, 1863-1873, hereafter A Series of Thirteen Letters. Of these thirteen letters formerly in the Hanley Collection, eight are dated by
Bucke. An additional letter from Louisa is on an otherwise blank surface of Hannah's
November 10, 1868 letter, which is also held in the Walt Whitman Collection.

The remaining letters from Louisa to Walt are held in the Charles E. Feinberg  Collection
of the Papers of Walt Whitman, Library of Congress (4 letters and one  fragment),
in the Walt Whitman Collection, Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript  Library, Yale University
(1 letter and a fragment), and in the Papers of Walt  Whitman, Clifton Waller Barrett
Library of American Literature, Albert H. Small  Special Collections Library, University
of Virginia (1 letter).The two letter fragments are associated. Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 16, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman (Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress; Beinecke Library,
Yale University). Of these, Bucke dated only one of the Feinberg letters. All letters from Louisa to
Walt in the preceding collections are included in this edition, but letters from Louisa
to other recipients have been excluded because the principle for inclusion is that
Louisa sent (or presumably intended to send) the letter to Walt. Eleven letters from
Louisa to Helen or Abby Price are held at the Morgan Library &amp; Museum. A single letter
from Louisa to Thomas Jefferson Whitman is held at Northwestern University. 
 

  

Date Assignment 

In his list of "Letters Written to Whitman" in the Correspondence (vol. 2), Miller encapsulated the difficulty of dating Louisa's letters and describes
his procedure: 

 


The literary executors undertook the difficult task of dating  Mrs. Whitman's letters,
and for the most part arrived at dates which, if not absolutely  certain, are at least
plausible. I have not hesitated to alter dates when in my judgment  they appeared
to be erroneous, but because of difficulties in reading Mrs. Whitman's hand  and because
of the absence of verifiable material in many of her letters, I cannot guarantee their
accuracy.Miller, Correspondence, 2:365, n. 1. 
 
  

Miller presumably applied the same procedure for Louisa's letters in volume 1 of the
Correspondence, though it should be noted that he in both cases generally also accepted the revised
dates by Gohdes and Silver in Faint Clews &amp; Indirections. As new incoming correspondence to Walt has been identified, Miller's list has been
updated in later volumes of the Correspondence and supplements by Miller himself and more recently by Genoways (the "Letters Written
to Walt Whitman" were combined with Walt's letters and re-named the "Calendar of Letters").
However, the minor alterations of dates for Louisa's letters in the updated calendars
are not the result of systematic reassessment for her letters, and the revised lists
of dates for Walt's incoming letter dates are sometimes very difficult to associate
with particular letters.For example, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 15–26, 1871 letter to Walt Whitman. Miller does not include this letter from the Hanley collection
in first edition of the Correspondence (1:369). Waldron dates the letter "about September 17, 1871," but Waldron's revised
date is not published in the updated "Calendar of Letters" unless the "[September?]"
letter is mistakenly assigned to the Trent collection (Correspondence, 1:369; Mattie, 72, n. 1; Miller, Correspondence, Second Supplement, 55; Genoways, Correspondence, 7:137). Likewise, see Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, September 5–23, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. Bucke on an accompanying slip of paper dates the letter November
1, 1863, and Miller dates the letter "about" September 3, 1863 (Correspondence, 1:144–145, n. 33). Berthold and Price propose approximate dates September 3, 1863
and September 10, 1863 (Dear Brother Walt, 72, n. 5; 75, n. 7). However, in the most recently updated "Calendar of Letters,"
this letter—probably—still has Miller's proposed date, "about" September 3, 1863 (Genoways,
Correspondence, 7:126). Because Genoways' revised "Calendar of Letters" serves as the backbone for the Whitman Archive letters and because footnotes in volumes 1 and 2 of the Correspondence allow for more certain identification of those letters that Miller re-dated from
the executors, Miller's Correspondence dates—as best as can be determined—are reported throughout this edition. To identify
which date Miller (or Genoways) assigned to a letter from Louisa in their calendars
is difficult, and that task has been undertaken assiduously but has remained secondary
to dating her letters properly.

The task of assigning dates for her letters can be illustrated by considering the
most common date assignments in her hand and a few individual examples of mis-dated
letters. The large letter collections are in bound volumes, so any association between
a letter and one of the few scattered envelopes is now a subject of conjecture. Thirty-three
of Louisa's letters have no reference at all to a date or day of the week, and forty-five
letters have only a day of the week, such as "sunday" or "tuesday." Dates on many
of the letters are marginally more informative, such as "16" or "26 thursday."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 16, 1870 and December 26, 1867 letters to Walt Whitman. Even the year for some brief letters is not obvious, and some dates in Louisa's hand
are not reliable. The executors and Miller assign the year 1865 to a letter that Louisa
in her hand dated "Cristmas," but I have reassigned the letter to the year 1863.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 25, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman. The most common procedure is to assign a month and year from context (Louisa's reference
to a letter from Walt or another family member) and then from her reference to the
day of the week or calendar date narrow the range of possible dates, which must then
be confirmed to accord, if possible, with additional information about the time of
writing from the content of the letter. Dates assigned in this manner are trusted
when no alternative seems possible, but annotation of events to which she refers shows
that she sometimes erred. She dated a letter in which she referred to Walt's Valentines
as "tuesday 14," and February 14 fell on Tuesday in 1871. The executors and Miller
assigned the letter to that year. However, Louisa in the letter referred to a man
named "vanvories" who was "shot sunday night," which must be Dominicus S. Vorhees,
a builder, who was shot not in 1871 but the previous year. She therefore wrote either
on Monday, February 14, or Tuesday, February 15, 1870: her "tuesday 14" cannot be
correct.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 14 or 15, 1870 letter to Walt Whitman (cf. Miller, Correspondence, 2:368).

I have revised the assigned date ranges or dates for seventy-one letters, almost forty
percent of them.For eleven letters I have revised the assigned range of dates by a few days, for twelve
revised the assigned range a week or more, and for three revised the assigned range
to a different month. In many cases I have replaced a range or questionable date with
an exact one: seven letter dates are altered by a day or more, eleven by a week or
more, three by a month or more, and two by a year or more. Also, twenty-seven letters that have not been listed previously in the Correspondence calendars are now assigned specific dates or date ranges. The extraordinary efforts
of the executor Bucke and previous editors of the letters—Miller, Gohdes and Silver,
Loving, Waldron, Berthold and Price, and Genoways—have made possible the systematic
re-dating of Louisa's letters.  


  
Annotation 
Because readers on the Whitman Archive are likely to encounter these letters with a search that returns an individual item
or during the process of browsing or studying a small series of letters from a particular
period, I have provided full historical, linguistic, and textual annotation for each
letter. The historical annotation is primarily one of the following types: a date
assigned; family members mentioned by name or indirectly; letters received by Louisa;
neighbors, friends, and soldiers; engineers and others associated with the Brooklyn
Water Works or the office of the Attorney General; publications by Walt and reviews
of his work in periodicals; current events of local or national significance as reported
in New York newspapers, primarily the Brooklyn Daily Eagle; other periodicals and books; geographical references to natural landmarks or named
places; ships; diseases or health conditions and treatment methods; and foodstuffs.
At the level of linguistic annotation, I have glossed unfamiliar words that are now
obsolete or are associated with regional dialect, words that may be difficult to recognize
in Louisa's phonetic spelling, and words that are presumably errors or which because
of the lack of syntactic markers may cause present-day readers difficulty. At the
level of textual annotation, I have noted expansions of shortened words or abbreviations,
words inferred from the physical documents rather than the digital reproductions,
and words based on transcriptions in documents for which the paper has deteriorated.
In some cases, annotations cross the boundary between explanatory and textual, such
as when likely readings are proposed when the combination of errors or omitted words
may have multiple causes: accidental omission of letters, paper damage, partial correction,
likely errors, etc.

For annotations to assign a date, I have relied on the following factors: 1) Louisa's
acknowledgment of receipt of Walt's letter or his acknowledgment of hers; 2) references
to receipt of letters by or from other family members; 3) references to periodical
publications of Walt's poems or reviews of his work; 4) references to city or national
political events as reported in the Brooklyn Daily Eagle, another newspaper, or Walt's or another family member's letter; 5) the absence of
acknowledgment or statement that a known letter has been received; 6) references to
the expected arrival or departure of Walt, another family member, or a family friend
for a visit; 7) internal consistency of an ongoing subject that is shared in another
family member's letters or confined to Louisa's and Walt's own; 8) similarity of paper
or ink or hand; 9) and, when no other evidence is available, the dates assigned by
executors or editors. As dates of so many letters depend on readings of ongoing subjects—such
as detecting linguistic echoes or abbreviated mentions of topics that may be treated
in non-extant letters—I offer full explanations for assigning letters to specific
dates or date ranges.

The Whitman Archive and its bibliography, along with Joel Myerson's Walt Whitman: A Descriptive Bibliography, Miller's first two volumes of the Correspondence and Genoways's seventh volume, and the previous editions of family correspondence
have been unfailing guides to Whitman scholarship, editions and publications, and
family letters. Scholarly biographies and reference works—like Walt Whitman: An Encyclopedia (1998) and A Whitman Chronology (1998)—are now supplemented by digital access to census records, to Brooklyn Public
Library city directories and the Daily Eagle, and many to publicly accessible or subscription-access libraries of nineteenth century
periodicals and books. All have contributed to the systematic dating and annotation
of these letters. No separate list of abbreviations for reference sources is maintained:
full bibliographical information is included in the footnotes to individual letters.


  
Transcription  
Editors and critics of Louisa's letters have applied various systems of punctuation-style
markup to ease the identification of syntactic units of prose. Gohdes and Silver in
Faint Clews &amp; Indirections and Miller in the Correspondence claimed, the former directly and the latter in policy and practice, that readers
deserve some degree of editorial intervention to distinguish Louisa's sentences and
sentence fragments."[W]e have spaced Mrs. Whitman's sentences or sentence fragments" (Gohdes and Silver,
Faint Clews &amp; Indirections, 183). Miller applies his general policy—retaining spelling but inserting end punctuation—to
Louisa Van Velsor Whitman's letters in the first volume (Correspondence, 1:16). For Miller's punctuation of extended quotations, see Correspondence, 1: 308, n.16; 1:341, n.6; 2:20, n. 3, and 2:36, n. 9. By contrast, Ceniza has defended the absence of punctuation markings as integral
to Louisa's style, which like Walt's Preface to the 1855 Leaves of Grass creates "a flow of thought that is unbroken by standard grammatical signs."Ceniza, Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers, 21. In that Preface, the poet adopted in place of standard punctuation signs a series
of space-separated points or periods that range in number from two to nine dots. Louisa
likewise had her own all-purpose punctuation mark, which is transcribed in this edition
as a closing parenthesis, but she employed her mark more flexibly than the closing
parenthesis in formal punctuation: her mark is used to close, pause, or temporarily
suspend a thought, much like Walt deployed the series of periods in the Preface.

Moon and Sedgwick like many others have claimed that Louisa never capitalized or punctuated:
this is not strictly true, as even they acknowledge.Moon and Sedgwick cite Louisa's "rare close parenthesis" ("Confusion of Tongues,"
Breaking Bounds, 25–26). But a search of her entire letters corpus for the most familiar punctuation marks
of nineteenth century prose—the comma, the period, the apostrophe, the dash—is pointless.
The lower-case "i" predominates in the surviving letters corpus, but some of her earliest
letters employ the capitalized form on occasion: over time she abandoned the upper
case form of the nominative first-person pronoun. She did capitalize some words, most
often names or titles of people outside her family: she always capitalized "Dr" and
the surname of her son-in-law "Heyde," and sometimes the initial letter in names is
so much larger than letters which follow that capitalization has been adopted as the
most appropriate transcription.

In any case, neither capitalization nor Louisa's one common punctuation mark was deployed
systematically or consistently. In her hand, the parenthesis-style mark varies in
shape: she most often wrote a very tall mark that resembles a closing parenthesis—which
is why that form has been adopted in the transcription—but sometimes she wrote a short
mark that resembles a slightly exaggerated comma. The tall mark in some instances
resembles a vertical pipe, but the three most common styles of the mark—exaggerated
comma, closing parenthesis, vertical pipe—have the same rhetorical function.Some marks that resemble an opening parenthesis are not deliberately shaped but an
accident of handwriting. No rhetorical significance is associated with the various shapes of the mark: all
serve as a weak stop or mark for a change in thought. I have not once in her letters
identified a parenthetical aside, a phrase that is marked off as an interruption.
In recognition of that quality, I have preferred the closing-parenthesis mark, except
in a few cases in which the curve is so pronounced in the opposite direction that
an opening parenthesis seems the better transcription. Her mark signals a brief stay
before the headlong rush of thought resumes.  

The practice of inserting extra space to mark off syntactic units, employed by Gohdes
and Silver and by Moon and Sedgwick, echoes the typed transcriptions that were prepared
in the early twentieth century for the three manuscript notebooks, Extensive Collection (Vol. 1 and Vol. 2) and A Series of Thirteen Letters, but the spacing of syntactic units is nowhere present in Louisa's manuscript letters.Gohdes and Silver, Faint Clews &amp; Indirections, 183. Moon and Sedgwick, "Confusion of Tongues," 29, n. 1. She employed occasional paragraph breaks, which are reproduced in this edition. In
one unusual case, a hand that is probably Louisa's has applied a texture of dashes
and corrections of capitalization, but those corrections—which are visible in the
manuscript letter but very faint in the digital images—may have been prompted by a
visiting school-age granddaughter.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, November 18, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. In all letters save that one, the capitalization, parenthesis-style closing mark,
and her idiosyncratic paragraphing are not employed with a sufficient degree of gradation
or specificity to substitute for formal punctuation. Ceniza's concise observation
is the authoritative word on the subject: Louisa's "lack of punctuation forces each
word to relate to the next on a more or less equal basis."Ceniza, Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers, 21. And Ceniza's sound advice has guided transcription practice on this edition: no extra
spacing to designate syntactic units and no clarifying punctuation marks have been
inserted into the text.

The absence of graphic means to identify syntactic units places greater emphasis on
written language as a sign system for oral performance, a script in which the reader
must intuit intonation and gesture. The effect is not easily discerned but often revealing
upon close study. Gohdes and Silver use extra whitespace, an em quad, to designate
independent sentences and sentence fragments. Their formal texture of punctuation
spaces is restrained and subtle, but some space markers that they insert lessen Louisa's
authority and break apart syntactically connected ideas. For example, in March 1869,
Louisa reported to Walt that she had been reading "Whispers of Heavenly Death" from
its appearance in The Broadway: A London Literary Magazine. Gohdes and Silver mark out syntactic units with spaces of em-quad length, a practice
that has been typical for separating sentences—including those with formal punctuation—during
most eras of printing before our own. 
 
 

well walter i have the whisper of heavenly death it lays here on the table by my side i
have read it over many times and have had one person ask me to let her take it hom i
said no i would rather not let it go out of my hands and am very glad i did so as
you wish me to reserve it i felt as if i should preserve it for i liked it it was
so solemn)Gohdes and Silver, Faint Clews &amp; Indirections, 201. 
 
 

The uninterrupted phrase "i said no i would rather not" is less decisive than an equally
plausible alternative rendering, if three short words are a single syntactic unit:
"i said no." Either reading is plausible in the manuscript. By contrast, the space
that Gohdes and Silver add between "i liked it" and "it was so solemn)" marks out
the final three words as a very short syntactic unit. The editors mark the phrase
as a "sentence," but their marking emphasizes the brevity of Louisa's utterance. Their
interpretive editorial act—attenuating the link between Louisa's attribution of solemnity
to the poem and her decision to keep in hand her copy of the poem—highlights instead
of her own agency her willingness to comply with Walt's wish.

Louisa used phonetic spelling—which is characteristic of the era in which she learned
to write—and she never disciplined her own spelling with the more regular forms of
mid-century print publication and dictionaries. However, her English spelling is no
more difficult than early eighteenth-century print or late nineteenth-century dialect.
As scholars and students who will read her words on the Whitman Archive may be presumed to share a serious interest in a mid-nineteenth-century poet, the
"convenience of readers" is not a sufficient justification for modernizing or regularizing
her spelling.

A few brief illustrations of her characteristic spellings and the editorial treatment
of her written hand may be ventured. Louisa is widely noted for writing "i" instead
of "I": the lower-case "i" is a defining mark of her style. Instead of an apostrophe
for possession or a contraction, she often (but not always) placed a space before
the "s," so it is "davis s" and "addams s express." She tended to include the space
if the concluding "s" is pronounced separately in a possessive word form: it is "george
s" but "jeffs" and "hatties." Our present-day contractions with an apostrophe, in
her hand have none: "wouldent," "couldent," and "dident." And she added a terminal
"f" after a pronounced "-gh" digraph: "enoughf " and "coughf." All of these are reasonably
common spellings for handwritten texts in her era. Her spelling "doo" is easily deciphered.
Readers may be briefly stymied by her "im," but familiarity with her habits for the
first-person nominative pronoun and contractions allows readers to decipher the form.

One word that is frequent but spelled many ways is her short form of "dollar," which
appears in most letters and is gloriously inconsistent: "dollar," but also "dlr,"
"doller," "dol," "dole," and "dolr" as well as plural forms of most variants. As no
regular form is ever settled upon, the most likely alphabetic characters in her word
form have been transcribed. Her numbers are very difficult—I for example transcribe
a regiment designation "14" that Miller transcribed as "94,"Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, August 31 or September 2, 1863 letter to Walt Whitman (cf. Miller, Correspondence, 1:45, n. 38). and readers not inclined to undertake an extensive study of her hand must trust the
editor's judgment. Louisa's own remark about the curious shapes of her numbers eased
an editor's frustration with her hand: "walt you may laughf at this figure three it
looks a little like a comic picture i cant help but laughf myself."Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, February 27, 1867 letter to Walt Whitman.

As with the many short forms of the word "dollar," editorial judgment is applied for
names and for words that are cut away in the documents or are obscured by ink or 
water stains or by paper deterioration, including tears and folds. Her spellings of
names are honored—for example, her spellings "maquire" and "maguire" refer to the
same name McClure—but the annotation provides full guidance and the regularized spelling.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, May 28–June 1, 1868 letter to Walt Whitman. Partial or probable readings are encoded with a markup tag to designate a word "unclear,"
and the editor's inferred reading is displayed between square brackets with a question
mark preceding the closing bracket. Only the doubtful letters are enclosed in the
brackets. 

Because some have regarded her as illiterate, silent correction could be seen as tilting
evidence toward my own view that she was literate. Therefore, no systematic editorial
smoothing has been applied aside from some very limited cases that are matters of
inescapable editorial judgment. I have tried to accurately follow her spellings of
the words that she wrote, even when her spelling is clearly faulty. For some probable
errors, such as "[r?]ecent [p?]arknesses," I have proposed in the notes possible readings
from context, such as "recent park [me]nesses," which would refer to a wave of criminal
activity in a nearby city park.Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, December 10, 1865 letter to Walt Whitman. Some of her spellings, the very few that accord with the following descriptions,
may be considered expanded or corrected silently: Louisa often squeezed the last few
letters of a word into the available space on the right margin of the page or inserted
letters above or turned her hand to a vertical orientation, and when writing hurriedly
she may have included only the faintest hint of a letter's shape. Letters are transcribed
without comment in the editorial transcription if some hint of the usual shape is
judged present. Like many writers who employ a cursive hand, she occasionally crossed
an "l" in a word, instead of the intended "t," and she sometimes placed a dot over
the "e" or neglected to place a dot over an e-shaped "i." These common slips in are
corrected silently.

Two qualities peculiar to her cursive hand, the form of her letter "x" and the similar
hand motion for her letters "v" and "p," may unsettle readers who compare the manuscript
to the transcribed text. She formed the "x" with two concave strokes (like two back-to-back
parentheses rather than two crossing strokes), and the strokes sometimes do not meet
at the expected joining point. That is the "x" in her hand and not an error. Her occasional
substitution of "p" for "v" or "v" for "p" will in the transcription read as a curious
improper spelling. The inadvertent substitutions are characteristic of her cursive
hand because she used a similar motion to start both letters: her cases of "p/v" and
"v/p" substitution are transcribed with the apparent letter in her hand and not corrected.


  
Note Marker Placement 
In the present design of the Whitman Archive, the mark to signal an annotation is a superscript footnote. The raised and numbered
mark may suggest to some readers that the editor by its placement has designated the
close of a syntactic unit in Louisa's prose. If a reader's interest is her comparative
disregard for the syntactic constraints of conventionally punctuated texts and the
placement of such notes distracts, please read her letters in photographic facsimile—you
will need to learn her hand. Editorially transcribed digital texts share with manuscripts
inscribed with ink or graphite on paper the constraints and affordances that inhere
to the conditions of the available or chosen medium. Where one attribute of a text
may be highlighted by a transformation into an alternate media form, another attribute
may be constrained or abolished. The transcribed text of Louisa's letters—given current
norms of the Whitman Archive's design—must with note markers for editorial annotation interrupt the textual representation
somewhere. Notes have been placed at a position which in the editor's judgment is
most apt for the note's content. Placement coincides often with the close of a named
entity, often with the conclusion of an abstract or specific reference that is deemed
to merit or benefit from explanatory annotation, and sometimes with the close of a
probable syntactic unit. Inevitably, the Whitman Archive will be redesigned and may at that time permit varieties of note styling quite different
from the capabilities and limits of today's editorial infrastructure or digital viewers
or devices.


  
Digital Publication   
This project, "walter dear": The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son Walt, is a digital-only publication on the Walt Whitman Archive, and it follows the guidelines of the "Editorial Policy Statement and Procedures"
and the "Encoding Guidelines,""About the Archive," Walt Whitman Archive, http://whitmanarchive.org/about/index.html. except for departures from those policies noted here. Because digital images of manuscript
letters from Louisa to Walt have been acquired for all letters, in no case do transcriptions
in this edition rely on manuscript book type transcriptions (with two minor exceptions)
or previously edited texts of the letters.In the two exceptions, I have consulted type transcriptions because portions of the
letter manuscripts have crumbled away since the transcriptions were prepared (see
Louisa Van Velsor Whitman, March 9–14, 1863 and March 19, 1863 letters to Walt Whitman). Every letter has been transcribed from the digital manuscript images, proofread silently
against the digital images, annotated, and then proofread orally against the digital
images. The transcriptions of the 144 letters in An Extensive Collection (Trent Collection, Duke University–Rubenstein Library) and the fourteen letters in
A Series of Thirteen Letters plus her letter on Hannah's November 10, 1868 letter (Walt Whitman Collection, University
of Texas–Ransom Center) have also been proofread silently against the original documents.
The remaining twelve letters—four on George Whitman's letters in the Trent Collection;
four plus the fragment in the Feinberg Collection, Library of Congress; one plus the
fragment in the Walt Whitman Collection, Beinecke, Yale University; and one in the
Clifton Waller Barrett Library, Albert H. Small Special Collections Library, have
been proofread only against the digital images.

In some cases, the text of the digital edition of the 144 letters bound in An Extensive Collection (Trent Collection, Duke) and A Series of Thirteen Letters (Walt Whitman Collection, Ransom Center) depart slightly from the digital image. The
most common reason for the divergence between the edited text and Louisa's text in
the digital image is that one can, during the examination of original documents, rotate
the manuscript book, closely review text along edges and folds, and identify ink or
pencil markings that are so faint as to be invisible or doubtful in the digital reproductions.

Secondary materials—envelopes, explanatory notes or date notes, and paratextual letter-book
materials like title pages, bindings, and type transcriptions—are reproduced when
on a letter surface but omitted when on a separate slip of paper. Information on separate
slips of paper is attested according to the general guidelines that follow. The three
known envelopes have not been reproduced. Bucke's dates on the manuscripts served
often as letter dates in Miller's Correspondence, so they have been reproduced and transcribed as editorial notes or recorded in explanatory
notes. Bucke's dates and explanatory notes on separate slips of paper are reproduced
with individual letters (some because they have been detached from the binding and
can be associated with a particular letter only by inference) but are addressed in
the annotation. Other items, such as two notes by Waldron that are placed loose in
An Extensive Collection (Trent Collection, Duke), are referenced when applicable but not reproduced. The
other paratextual materials in An Extensive Collection and in A Series of Thirteen Letters (Walt Whitman Collection, Ransom Center)—title pages, bindings, mounted catalog clippings
in the end papers or the inside front cover, mounting pages for the letters, and type
transcriptions—are not reproduced.


  
Acknowledgments 
This letters project, "walter dear": The Letters from Louisa Van Velsor Whitman to Her Son Walt, has relied on the support of multiple institutions and individuals. Indispensable
support was provided by the David M. Rubenstein Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, which
prepared digital images and granted to the Walt Whitman Archive permission to publish all letters from the Trent Collection. A generous grant for
the project Walt Whitman and Reconstruction from the National Historical Publications and Records Commission enabled transcription and on-site proofreading at Duke University. Digital images
and permission to reproduce letters have also been provided by the following libraries
and institutions: Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center, University of Texas; Library
of Congress; Beinecke Rare Book &amp; Manuscript Library, Yale University; and Albert
H. Small Special Collections Library, University of Virginia. Two colleagues at Kent
State University were indispensable: assistant editor Felicia L. Wetzig, who prepared
most initial transcriptions and annotations and assisted with the majority of the
first round of oral proofreading, and Cathy Tisch in the Institute for Bibliography
and Editing, who assisted with oral and silent proofreading after annotation, double-checking
corrections, and many tasks of clerical processing. Again indispensable are Kenneth
M. Price—who first suggested the project to me and who shared generously his deep
familiarity with Whitman scholarship and his keen editorial eye—and the staff of the Whitman Archive, especially Elizabeth Lorang. My debts to the Whitman Archive; Edwin Haviland Miller's and Ted Genoways' Correspondence; Sherry Ceniza's Walt Whitman and 19th-Century Women Reformers; Gay Wilson Allen's Solitary Singer; and the four recent biographers in his great tradition (Justin Kaplan, Jerome M.
Loving, Davis S. Reynolds, and Robert Roper); previous editors of family letters (Clarence
Gohdes and Rollo G. Silver, Jerome Loving, Randall D. Waldron, and Kenneth M. Price
and Dennis Berthold); and Joel L. Myerson's Walt Whitman: A Descriptive Bibliography exceed the bounds of scholarly citation. The following named persons provided significant
contributions to proofreading, annotation, or guidance on individual matters: Laura
Weakly, Natalie Raabe, Heather Kaley, Cathryn Humes, Zachary King, Will Hansen, Debby
Applegate, Matt Cohen, Randall McCleod, Linda McCurdy, Valentino Zullo, Murray Goldstone,
Debby Painter, and Sigrid Pohl Perry. Many are the debts to librarians at previously
named institutions, especially Kent State and Duke University. All errors I claim
as my own. The editorial work on these letters is dedicated to three twenty-first
century mothers, Natalie Raabe, Margaret "Peggy" Ashner, and Molly Raabe, and to the
working-class mothers whose letters are not preserved in library or museum archives.
