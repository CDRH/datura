         <p>Deposition of Joseph Nally.</p>

      </div>

      <div class="body ">

         <p>I was well acquainted with Capt John B. Kirby and in his employment in his farm a great many years since, I remember his negro boy Harry, he was then an infant, when I was eighteen years old I left Captain Kirby, and remained about <del>till</del> for about two years when I returned. I cannot remember the year when I left him, but I distinctly recollect that I was about eighteen years of age and that Harry was then about two years old. I have known Harry from that time to this and feel satisfied that he is not at this time more than forty five if as much. I am not quite certain as to my age but I am somewhere between fifty eight and sixty years old, and Harry I believe is at this time between forty four and forty five years old.</p>
