         <p>If a slave escape from his master in Virginia, and be found in
            Washington, and there sold by his master, the slave does not thereby acquire a
            right to freedom.

            <span class="smallcaps">This</span> was a petition for freedom.

         <p>The petitioner was permitted to come from Virginia, to the city of Washington to
            see his wife, and to return by a certain day; but he stayed some months longer, and
            was taken up in Washington, by an agent of his owner, but escaped and eloped, and
            the agent sold him to the defendant, while he was so eloped and while he was in the
            city of Washington.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>The petitioner's counsel prayed the Court to instruct the jury that upon the
            state of facts the petitioner was entitled to his freedom.
         </p>
         
         
         <p>But the Court refused, and instructed the jury that he
            was not entitled to his freedom under the 
            <div class="bibl code">Maryland law of 1796, c. 67 </div>.
