                <p>I have just sent Ben a letter I have received from my publisher William Morrow about the book I am writing and the chance for making a moving picture of the Horse Dance. I have told Ben to explain this letter to you, as it will be better for you to get it direct from the letter than for me to tell you about it. You will see that my publisher thinks the best chance is to try to make a picture of the whole book rather than of the Horse Dance alone. I think perhaps this will be the best way, because there will be a story to tell and people like stories. Anyway, you may be sure that my publisher means business and knows how to do business. If anything comes of this, you can depend upon me to see that you get what is just as your portion.</p>
                
                <p>You say that some white men have tried to get your story from you and I know you would lie by refusing to give anything to them. You will understand that many people are running around the country trying to be writers and almost all of them are unknown and could do nothing with the material if they had it. We are going to do something real with this book about the tree that never bloomed and I am sure that you are going to be a good deal happier because of this book. Keep a good heart and be patient until next spring when the book appears. I have to work hard on the book and be patient too, and I can do both with a strong heart because I know the book is wise and good and that thousands of people will find good in it.</p>
                
                <p>This letter gives the kindest thoughts to all your family there and real affection to you.</p>
