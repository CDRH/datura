      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Mott: — </div>
      
      
      	
      <p>I was very glad to receive your letter of yesterday, and was surprised to learn that
         you wrote me from McGregor, Iowa. This is the first letter I have received from you
         since you were here. During the past month two other letters addressed to me (both
         containing drafts) have been lost, and I fear that at least one other letter has gone
         astray.
      </p>
      	
      <p>It's the best of news that you will write 
         <em>two</em> articles about my work. The more the better: and especially when the work is done
         by a man of real understanding. I feel quite safe in your hands, Mott.
      </p>
      	
      <p>The prospect for the success of the epic cycle is surprisingly good and grows better
         steadily.
      </p>
      	
      <p>"The Song of the Indian Wars" is going on in a most satisfactory way, and I count
         it a great privilege to have so tremendous a theme to handle. Four hundred twenty
         five lines in four months! Two glorious years of work left! It's fine to be alive,
         have a big job to do, and know how to do it.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Be sure that I am deeply grateful for your friendship and cooperation.</p>

      <p>My people were glad to be remembered and all send kindest regards.</p>
      
      
      
      <p>I feel sure that you will have little difficulty in finding a place for the second
         article. Am eager to see both. The four Macmillan books (poetry) are all going into
         new editions.
