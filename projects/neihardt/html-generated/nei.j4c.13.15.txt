<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>

<p>It must have been a week ago that I <u>thought</u> a delighted letter to you about the last issue of the Quarterly. Of course, I was delighted, not only with the fact that a good share of the issue was devoted to my stuff, but because the whole magazine shows a surprising improvement. You are doing something worth doing. I should think the College would feel grateful to you.</p>

<p>Since I can't write an article specially for the Quarterly now, would you care to have a couple already written and, of course, unknown to your readers?</p>

<p>I don't see much vacation this year. I shall have three weeks, as usual, on pay, but I have to spend a whole week at Penn State and the going and coming will kill another week.</p>

<p>Four candidates for degrees, in different parts of the country, are doing theses on my stuff this year - so far as I know. Reading (Pa.) High School wants my picture <del>for its</del> to hang. Little straws here and there continue to point in a hopeful direction, and the sales of the school point in a hopeful direction, and the sales of the school editions increase. If anything intelligent could be done by way of pushing the school editions, or even giving them half a chance, things would be doing.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Endless love, and congratulations on the success you are making with the Quarterly.</span>

<br/>Jno
