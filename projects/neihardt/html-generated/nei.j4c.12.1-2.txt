<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
<p>Mr. Johns - the big boss under Mr. Pulitzer - was in my office a little while ago and stayed about a half hour just talking about everything pleasant. Incidentally he said that the Sunday editor had spoken to him about the article you proposed to write on my stuff. He asked what I thought about running it somehow in connection with my column. I told him I thought that would be wrong, that if any article should be accepted, it ought to be used as a Sunday story. I told him that you are the editor of my school editions, and he seemed not to have known. It interested him a good deal. I told him not to feel that he ought to run an article on me and my work, and he said he couldn't see why the P-D should ignore the work of its own men. He gave the Sunday editor orders to have you submit an article. So I am supposing that you will hear soon. Perhaps you have heard already.</p>
<span class="closer">
<span class="salute">Love always,</span>

<br/>Jno.
</span>
<p>Johns seems to have no notion that I am thoroughly happy and satisfied. Certainly the whole bunch treats me with great respect and kindness. Perhaps, for the time, I should take it all differently.</p>
