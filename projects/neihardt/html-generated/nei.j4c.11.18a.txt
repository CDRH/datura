      <p>The two lectures on POETIC VALUES are entitled "Science and Poetry" and "The Creative
         Dream". These, I understand, are to be given in the evening. My readings in the mornings
         will be from THE SONG OF THE INDIAN WARS, which is a part of my Epic Cycle of the
         West. From the Song of the Indian Wars I shall probably want to read the two sections
         called "The Beecher's Island Fight" and "The Death of Crazy Horse". Each of these
         is short enough to leave me time for some lyrics.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A formal contract is not necessary. You need only state the price for the four lectures.</p>
