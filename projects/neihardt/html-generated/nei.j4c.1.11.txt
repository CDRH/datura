      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Davis:— </div>
      
      	
      <p>I have just sent another Indian story to Mr.
         Titherington. It seems to me considerable better than my average,
         and I have asked that it be considered for the Munsey alone.
         I wished to write you about this, fearing that you might not
         understand me. I want you to know that I have not been
         dissatisfied with the manner in which any of my stories have
         been judged by you people. I have made the request mentioned
         in connection with this story because I am afraid that the 
         subtle meaning in it would be overlooked by more readers of
         the All-Story than of the Munsey.
      </p>
      	
      <p>With me, writing is both a business and a passion, with
         the accent upon the latter. I want to see those stories which
         contain the most of me, in a position to reach the people
         who will most readily understand.
      </p>
      	
      <p>If you were personally acquainted with me, you would 
         see just what I mean.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I am glad to have Narcisse in the Scrap-Book. I like
         that magazine more and more. As I think of it now, the first
         version of that story was rather rank. But I am not one of
         those who must study a lesson many times before it is learned.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I hope to see you within two years; and if it is in the
         spring that I come, you shall take something on me.
         Always remember that the sentiments expressed in the verses
         in which I drank to you, always hold good with me.
      </p>
