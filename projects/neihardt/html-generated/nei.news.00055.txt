      <p>THIS is no book for the winter season, nor is it well adapted to the needs of any
         normal spring.  It is distinctly summer fiction, though not necessarily in the derogatory
         sense of being frivolous, and it should prove especially effective on torrid, breathless
         nights.  It is a veritable literary frigidaire, capable of furnishing the nervous
         reader with exactly 16 different kinds of cold-chills-down-the-back.  Very sensitive
         people should not venture to read the book by night, even in late July, without having
         a fur coat near at hand; and those who have ill-fitted false teeth should remove them
         before reading.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>For here 16 of the leading literary conjurors of England have entered into a conspiracy
         of horror.  Ghosts!  Sixteen of them, and each a little more gruesome than the other,
         if that be scientifically possible.  It does not matter how wide your acquaintance
         among ghosts may be.  Here you are almost sure to find some you have never had the
         pleasure of meeting before.  It is doubtful if even Sir Arthur Conan Doyle has met
         them all.

      <p>May Sinclair contributes the first shiver in a tale called “The Villa Desiree.”  It
         seems that a certain young, beautiful and sensitive Mrs. Carson died horribly on her
         wedding night shortly before the appearance of the bridegroom, Louis.  The cause of
         her death was unexplained until one Mildred, who tells the story, slept in the same
         room shortly before the day set for her marriage with the same Louis.  The young Mrs.
         Carson had seen something.  Mildred saw it too, and as a result she immediately broke
         off the engagement.  To tell what she saw would be unfair, but it was certainly something
         sufficiently horrible.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It must not be supposed that all the chills here offered are wholly unpleasant.  There
         is one yarn called “The Amorous Ghost” that is amusing as well as cooling.  It is
         concerned with the nocturnal experiences of an estimable citizen who, having gone
         to bed early, was drowsily aware that his wife had come in, undressed and gotten into
         bed.  Evidently she was very cold, for it seemed that an icy wind was blowing under
         the covers.  Imagine the gentleman’s state of mind when, an hour or two later, his
         wife actually did come in!  Golly!  That one calls for a hot water bottle at the base
         of the spine!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The conspirators in horror are as follows:  Hugh Walpole, May Sinclair, Walter de
         la Mare, Mrs. Belloc-Lowndes, Charles Whibley, D. H. Lawrence, L. P. Hartley, Enid
         Bagnold, Algernon Blackwood, Oliver Onions, Desmond McCarthy, Arthur Machen, Denis
         Mackall and Mary Webb.  None of the tales has ever been published before.
