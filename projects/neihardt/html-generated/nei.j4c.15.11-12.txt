                <p>Yes, David Graham Philpps too. I remember well when he was living &amp; going strong. Had very big reputation shortly before his death. Is being revived somewhat now. I've picked up first editions of him when found, &amp; intend to keep on.</p>
                
                <p>There's another prose writer, <em class="hi">truly</em> neglected and a great spirit with <u>uncanny powers</u>; he died in 1900 at the age of 43 — want &amp; under-appreciation, I understand. His name is Frank Hamilton Cushing &amp; his "Zuni Folk Tales" has just been reissued after being out of print nearly 30 years. <del/> The real story of Cushing's life &amp; work would be a corking thing.</p>
                
                <p>Richard Burton, I'm sure, would be delighted to write about Arthur Upson, &amp; I have other strings to pull for original stuff. Upson was a real poet. Suicide — drowning. I knew his mother slightly — some of his pals well. Have his complete works in 2 vols.</p>

<p>I'll get Burton for you when you want him.</p>

                <p>Do encourage your colleague to do his Virgil study. I gather, from a remark you made, that he's no sentimental slop-bucket &amp; will say what he believes he can demonstrate. To reveal value is a great part of the creation of value, and if your colleague will collaborate, he's more than welcome.</p>

                <p>There's no end of work for your mag to do. I could sit here an afternoon &amp; think up enough real features to keep you jumping for three years. No exaggeration at all.</p>

                <p>The last number <em class="hi">is</em> a corker. I was familiar with all the sonnets, which fact acted automatically to keep me from exclaiming, as I should have done otherwise.  A <u>very distinguished</u> number quite obviously; and <em class="hi">beautifully</em> done! You began your mag just when the very strong movement toward regional culture was getting a good start in many sections. Good omen for you.</p>
