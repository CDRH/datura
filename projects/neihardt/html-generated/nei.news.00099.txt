<h3>Wholeseome Suspicion</h3>
<h3><em class="hi">THE HISTORY OF PSYCHOLOGY.</em> By W. H. Pillsbury, Ph.D. (W. W. Norton &amp; Co., inc (New York).</h3>
<p>THANKS to the popularization of Freudianism and the growing demand for eight-cylinder <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>anship,  it is quite a la mode to indulge in psychologizing these days.  Nearly everybody seems to be doing it more or less.  To the <span class="unclear ">[generality?]</span>, psychology often seems to signify the process of discovering highly reprehensible “com-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> in the other fellow and ex-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> the apparent best of him <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> terms of mean motives.  To the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> it seems to signify a bag<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> smooth tricks whereby a pro-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> victim may be induced <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> buy something he really doesn’t want and can’t afford.  (One of <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> most amusing indoor sports is<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> of being streanuously <span class="unclear ">[pscyhologized?]</span> by a tyro with something to <span class="unclear ">[sell?]</span> whose own mental processes <span class="unclear ">[are as?]</span> transparent as a pane of <span class="unclear ">[glass?]</span>.</p>

<p>But it is not only we of the general public who seem to be <span class="unclear ">[confused?]</span> as to this matter of psychology.  Even those who cheerily confess that they are experts<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> so greatly in alleged fundamentals as to make a layman wonder what the deuce they know about the knower, anyhow.  But <span class="unclear ">[now a?]</span> new theory is propounded <span class="unclear ">[with?]</span> such an air of triumphant <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>, and such a blare of pub-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> trumpets that considerable <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> of the reading public are <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> to accept the latest as the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>.</p>

<p>Under the circumstances, it might be well for the generality of <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> spend some time in reviewing <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> history of men’s guesses on the <span class="unclear ">[subject?]</span> by way of arriving at a welcome suspicion.  Dr. Pillsbury’s work here noted offers any <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> of average understanding <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> valuable opportunity.  For <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> years Dr. Pillsbury was professor of philosophy and director of the psychological laboratory at Cornell University.  In 1910 he <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> elected president of the American Psychological Association.  He lectured in psychology at Columbia and in 1923 he was exchange professor at the Sorbonne, Paris. <span class="unclear ">[He?]</span> is now in charge of the department of psychology at the University of Michigan.</p>

<p>Beginning with pre Socratic <span class="unclear ">[thinkers?]</span> Dr. Pillsbury sets forth <span class="unclear ">[in?]</span> a direct and easily readable manner “the story of the development of the interpretation man has put upon his acts and his thinking” through the ages.  He ends with Watson in America and Kuhler in Europe.  It is a long way, as we view time from the Atomists to the Behaviorists, from Demokritos to Watson: but if these may be regarded as representative of the beginning and the end of thinking about the human mind, many a reader is likely to wonder if any real progress has been made.  Happily, as Dr. Pillsbury’s story shows, these are not the beginning and the end.  Fashions come and go in theorizing as in everything else, and the time-mood determines the prevailing direction of search.  It is not improbable that along the way somewhere some thinker, now neglected, may have come much nearer to the truth we seek than either the ancient or the modern mechanist.  For a wild guess, Fechner might be named in this connection.  And there was one F. W. H. Myers who, naturally enough considering the highly “practical” persuasion of our day, is not mentioned at all by Dr. Pillsbury.
