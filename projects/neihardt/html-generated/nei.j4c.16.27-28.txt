      <p>This is in reply to yours of March 23.</p>
      
      
      <p>You must have learned by this time that Long Lance committed suicide in Los Angeles
         several days ago. Too bad, but I was suspicious as to the future of Long Lance so
         far as any genuine significance is concerned. His New York life was certain to be
         fatal to the Indian in him, and it was the Indian in him that mattered, if anything did. The manner of his going seems to have been of a piece with the New York folly.

      <p>Don't worry about doing the right thing by reviewing BLACK ELK. As a matter of fact,
         nothing is needed but the statement of your own feelings about the book. You struck
         the key-note in something you said about it in a recent letter, and you will not of
         course overlook the social implications of the vision.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have recently received a letter from Miss Deloria of the Department of Anthropology
         in Columbia University. Her grandfather was a chief and medicine man of the Yankton
         Sioux and her father was the same. Both by birth and training she is an authority,
         and I have known of her as such for many years. She seems to have been bowled over
         by the Black Elk Book, and said that she had not hoped that there could really be
         a white man who could get on the inside of the Indian religion as it had been taught
         to her in her childhood. I do not care to "use" Miss Deloria, though I have asked
         her if she could help in some way, and I think a Morrow representative will have her
         out to lunch to see what can be done.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The reviews of the book from all over the country have been excellent in intention,
         and sometimes actually excellent. There have been only two or three exceptions so
         far.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am amused to note with what naive faith reviewers accept, in a literal sense, the
         statement that I am letting Black Elk do all the speaking. I need not tell you how
         this is, and I am hoping that this may go so far as to give Black Elk a Pulitzer prize
         for autobiography! This would be a masterpiece of unconscious humor. The book is absolutely
         true to Black Elk's spirit and meaning, far more true than anything Black Elk could
         ever say could possibly be. Do you

         get this, or is it confusing to you? I think it is not likely to confuse you in the
         least. If you could spend a day with Enid's stenographic report, out of which the
         book was mined, the whole thing would be made clear. But don't tell anybody about
         this.

      <p>Waiting until April will in no way lessen the effect of what you may do for the book.</p>
