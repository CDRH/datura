      <div class="salute">My dear Miss Teasdale:-- </div>
      
      
      
      <p>I am very grateful to you for your generous letter written at Rome, and for the copy
         of "Helen of Troy" which was sent to me from your home.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I hope my second letter did not make me appear too importunate. I was afraid you might
         not feel at once the sincerity of my motive. I look upon true poets as brothers and
         sisters, and whenever I can blow a trumpet before any one of them, I am happy to do
         so. We do not care who does the great work. Perhaps in some inscrutable way we are
         all the same person.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I love your blank verse poems on great women. Aside from the exquisite quality of
         the verse and the fine sense for epithets, I am deeply interested in a good woman's
         outlook upon the great passion. I used to see so differently; but now that I have
         a wee daughter, I begin to understand.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>My wife, who is a sculptor of really remarkable ability, wishes me to send you her
         congratulations and sisterly greetings. You are of the same age.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Please do not forget to let me have that photograph.</p>
