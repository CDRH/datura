      <h3>Getting into the Intellectual Game</h3>
      
      <p>A LIBRARIAN of South London reports a policeman who constantly draws sociological
         books and never any other kind, of a chimney sweep who reads assiduously books of
         art, of a bricklayer who studies works of science of the more erudite kind.
      </p>
      
      <p>If anybody in this or any other modern civilized community wishes to be intellectual,
         he has the privilege.  The way lies open and means are at hand.  He may interest himself
         in any subjects he chooses, and become learned in them, provided he has the will,
         the patience, the mental curiosity.
      </p>
      
      <p>Poverty is no bar.  There is nothing intellectual about a lot of persons who have
         money to burn.  Rich, poor, or neither, such persons never can experience the incentive
         to the intellectual life.  They bar themselves, they are not barred.  They miss a
         world of interest, but they never know their loss.  They go through the world not
         knowing what is in it.
      </p>
      
      <p>Schools and colleges are helps, but they cannot guarantee to their graduates the intellectual
         life.  Many an educated man, many a successful man has no participation in the intellectual
         life, while someone whom you wouldn’t suspect, someone who is taught to read and write
         and little more, is simply reveling in the intellectual life on the sly, having his
         fun all to himself.  Such a man isn’t wasting his evenings in saloons or hanging about
         the streets.  He may be occupying a hall room, but he transforms it by use into a
         temple of Muses, with a special Muse of History, of Science or of Art to preside.
      </p>
      
      <p>No doubt the head of our own Public Library could tell tales to match those of the
         Librarian of South London, of men and women unsuspected who as an amusement and an
         improvement read serious books on this or that subject, who keep their minds alert,
         their interest keen, who daily get a lot out of life through their brains and do not
         stupefy their perceptions through their stomachs.
      </p>
      
      <p>Gentle reader, it is up to you whether you will be a participant in the stirring intellectual
         life of these our marvelous times.  A million dollars would not aid you much in that
         endeavor.  It is a matter of pure personal equation.  The humblest toiler in Minneapolis
         today has larger chances to live the intellectual life than did anybody in America
         a hundred years ago.  That life is much more intense and interesting now.  It offers
         a hundred fold more facilities of approach.
