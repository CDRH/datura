      <p>I have been a reader of PRESENT DAY AMERICAN LITERATURE from the first number to the latest, and have come to feel a genuine respect and
         admiration for it. Its founder and editor, Doctor Julius Temple House, is a richly
         literate man with warm, human sympathies; and he has, more than most of the scholars
         that I know, a fine sense of all time and all men. Knowing the past, he is forward
         looking, and he is courageous in the expression of what he feels and sees. America
         has few periodicals indeed that so richly deserve to live as does PRESENT DAY AMERICAN LITERATURE. Just as we must look to the smaller colleges for the preservation of genuine culture,
         so it seems we must look to the smaller and independent magazines for guidance in
         such a time as ours. Among these, PRESENT DAY AMERICAN LITERATURE is conspicuous.
