      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I was delighted to receive your good long letter this morning. I'm glad you wrote
         me all that about the magazine and your feeling. Your feeling is right, but it remains
         true that your magazine has been a credit to you. Still, I know that it has not been
         what you could make it if you could get the right fellows on the job. I have an intellectual
         carpenter here who writes for me occasionally. His name is J. E. Robinson, and he
         will try his hand on a thing for you. It may 
         <del class=""></del> be a very good thing. He seemed pleased this morning when I broached the subject.

      <p>Wonderful reception at the State Teachers' Assn. in Oklahoma City. 10,000 teachers
         and lots of enthusiasm. My last audience, which was very large, fell hard for me.
         The other was a section meeting - English teachers - not so large, but very much for
         me evidently. The newspaper over there gave me a dinner, and it was a joy. Golden
         evening. I wound up by taking a plane back, but got only as far as Tulsa as the plane
         did not go through that day. Wonderful way to travel - seems the slowest possible
         mode of transportation, but we made 110 in 45 minutes with a brisk tail wind. It's
         the only way to travel, I feel. And hereafter, when ever possible I'll take a plane.
         Try it, and you'll be converted at once.

      <p>I'm going to take a three weeks trip through the Indian country in July. Sig will
         drive me in our Ford, and we'll have a time. Can you accompany us? Both Sig and I
         are looking forward to the trip. I bought a Ford sedan - old model T - in fine

         shape with this in mind. We use it now to drive in and out morning and evening. Saves
         carfare, as all three of us now come to town every day. The Gardner is in the garage
         for the winter.

      <p>Comrade, your continuing affection is one of the few really valuable things in this
         world for me. 
         <del class="It">It</del> I feel that way about you all the time. It seems wonderful that such a relation should
         actually persist year after year with no signs of petering out. Pretty good for this
         world, I'd say.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In my last letter to you I made a remark about this civilization of ours 
         <del class=""></del>being a fool. I did not mean that the men and women 
         <del class="in it">in it</del> are fools. 
         <del class=""></del>Many are, of course, but millions certainly are not. I meant that the social scheme, based
         as it is so largely on lying and shenanigan and on the ideal 
         <del class=""></del>of acquisition, is 
         <del class=""></del> certainly leading us to terrible catastrophe. Maybe not very soon, but it must come.
         I call that sort of civilization a fool. Your remark about Carlyle's generalization
         is quite correct; but I could not make that sort of statement. I do love poor human
         beings like myself. I can't help loving them, for surely I need love as much as they.

      <p>Write Prof. B. A. Botkin, University of Oklahoma, Norman, asking him to write an article

         <del class=""></del> what he and others down there are doing in the way of collecting folk lore. He publishes
         a very interesting and valuable magazine called FOLK-SAY, A Regional Miscellany. Tell
         him I told you to write. This may be a good connection for you.
