                <span class="salute">Dear Mrs. Aly:</span>
                
                <p>That <u>was</u> a good letter — yours of the 9th received only yesterday. (It's a long way out there!)</p>
                
                <p>You certainly hit the bull's eye when you pointed out that my world-view is 
                    <u>both</u> Aristotelian and Platonic. That is why I wrote 
                    <u>Poetic Values</u> — to show that there is <u>no gap between the two</u>, that our scale of values
                    <span class="h6">28</span>

                    is continuous. All our values, from "lowest" to "highest" — from common sense through science and on through the esthetic, the ethical, the religious values <u>are obviously</u> creations in consciousness from selected data of our experience. It is commonly assumed, without examination of that assumption, that our 
                    <u>sense values</u> are "objective" and therefore "real". But they are created in consciousness too.	
                    
                    <span class="hr"> </span><span class="pageimage"><a href="large/nei.j4c.21.28-34_0002a.jpg" rel="prettyPhoto[pp_gal]" title="&lt;a href=&#34;large/nei.j4c.21.28-34_0002a.jpg&#34; target=&#34;_blank&#34; &gt;open image in new window&lt;/a&gt;"><img src="thumbnails/nei.j4c.21.28-34_0002a.jpg" class="display &#xA;            "/></a></span>

                    Surely, nothing in the "sense world" is essentially as we conceive it. The <u>physicists back us 100% in this view</u>, as I showed 36 years ago in <u>Poetic Values</u>; and since then they have become more and more obviously supporters of that view. In brief, this is what happens, as I've set forth in <u>Poetic Values</u>;

                    The horizontal line represents the state of consciousness in which the values at any point are 
                    <u>conceived</u>. It is commonly, and <u>wrongly</u>, supposed that there is only <u>one valid state of awareness</u> — the sense state of common sense and science. If this were true, there would be no art, no religion, no sense of beauty, <u>no love</u>.

                    Proceeding left to right, the consciousness arrives at a point where the preconception of "the world" as <u>solid</u>, "objective" fades out. The consciousness expands, is aware of larger relations, and out of this <del><span class="unclear ">[?]</span>other "<span class="unclear ">[?]</span></del> state (and higher ones) <u>creates the values pertinent to such</u> a state or states and the process is the

                <p>Perhaps you will read <u>Poetic Values</u> with this sketch in view. This is <em class="hi">not</em> <u>Idealism</u> in Bishop Berkeley's sense at all! It <u>is</u> obvious when one comes to think it. I know from my own experience that it is so. The expanded view of "the world" illuminates and gives meaning to the narrower, "lower" view.

                    I allowed myself to tell you <del/> about my athletic leanings in youth, because they were concerned with a vital part of the scale. And the same excess <del/> vitality that operated on the lower levels, has continued to operate on the higher levels — <u>even now</u>. It is all one pattern.

                    <u>becoming</u> and the shaping of the pattern. I am still working on the pattern, slowly fitting it to some larger pattern of which I am becoming more more aware.</p>

Indeed, I know the inside of it very well. Also, I have often found the way out <u>through</u> the <u>poetic miracle</u> and also prayer. <u>Poetic Values</u> explains this also.</p>
