      <h3>A Study of Genius</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <em>The Dominant Passion.</em> By Marguerite Bryant. Duffield.
      </h4>
      
      <p>MANY theories have been advanced as to the nature of that special mental adaptability
         which is called genius.  A famous alienist has characterized it as a neurosis, a phase
         of degeneracy closely allied to madness.  Psychologists have explained it as a “psychorhagic
         diathesis”; that is, a predisposition to subliminal uprushes; which is merely a complicated
         restatement of the matter in question, and the term “subliminal” is little more than
         a fantastic figure of speech, poetic rather than scientific.  A still more fanciful
         theory is that of the spiritualists, ancient and modern, who have assumed it to be
         an extreme sensitiveness to the influence of alleged disembodied intelligences.  Whatever
         it is, we know that it cannot be produced by any amount of mental training, and that
         it must be credited with a great share of the glory of mankind.  It furnishes one
         of the most alluring and important problems which psychology attempts to solve, for
         through the phenomena of genius we seem to approach very near to the secret of human
         personality.
      </p>
      
      <p>In “The Dominant Passion” we have a remarkable study of various phases of genius in
         the realm of art.  While the author is concerned primarily with the social aspect
         of genius and the artistic temperament, the study provokes thought and is well worth
         reading.
      </p>
      
      <p>The persons of the drama are as follows: Andrea Brandon, an artist of extraordinary
         vision and technique, who paints saints and martyrs yet is himself rather Mephistophilean;
         Andrea’s young son, Lawrence, a prodigy in music, who, because of his beautiful head,
         is used by his father for a model and kept virtually in a state of slavery; Honor
         Passfield, a young lady novelist; and the painter’s cousin, Anthony Brandon, a bacteriologist
         whose dominant passion is concerned with the discovery of a preventive for a disease
         prevalent in northern Italy.
      </p>
      
      <p>The theme of the story is the ruthlessness of Andrea Brandon in the pursuit of artistic
         success; and while the other characters are well worked out, they exist chiefly for
         the purpose of acting as foils to the amazing egotism of Andrea, concerned only with
         self-expression and using as raw material everything that comes in his way.  “The
         huge artistic Me and the tiny universe” is an utterance that might have come from
         Andrea Brandon.  The character, as one views it when the book is finished, is convincing
         and impressive, if not quite lovable.
      </p>
      
      <p>In the marriage of Honor Passfield, the novelist, and Anthony Brandon, the scientist,
         the author creates and utilizes an opportunity for studing [sic] the nature of genius
         in woman and its relation to her normal function as a mother.  This portion of the
         story is singularly sane, considering the chance offered for feministic vagaries.
         It raises an interesting question as to the possible indentity [sic] of the creative
         artistic impulse and the maternal instinct, a definite answer to which might solve
         the problem fundamental in the “woman’s movement” of which we hear so much. 
      </p>
      
      <p>“The Dominant Passion” can hardly be expected to achieve popularity, though it will
         doubtless gain a respectable following.  Many opportunities for sensationalism are
         deliberately ignored by the author.
      </p>
      
      <p>If the book reaches a second edition, it is to be hoped that certain small but disturbing
         errors may be corrected.  A book so sincere and thoughtful deserves to be faultless
         in details of grammar, rhetoric and typography.
