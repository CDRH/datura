<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
<p>I have purposely refrained from expressing to you very much of what I know to be true about the world situation. I did not want to seem <u>too</u> despairing. With me it has too often been terrible, but I've decided at last - or so I think - that I must guard against tearing myself to pieces, since nothing can be done to help. <u>We are now living in a vast kindergarten without a teacher!</u></p>
                
<p>I do not look forward to any special or inevitable "great day beyond" the growing darkness - not in this world. But it is not inconceivable that what is preparing all over the world may greatly decrease the earth's population, and that alone would be a favorable circumstance. Also, the profit system will have been wiped out - perhaps another favorable circumstance. Anyway, if one, being human, must hope, it is necessary to look  beyond what is inevitable - how far beyond God knows &amp; he probably non-existent!</p>
                
<p>But there are thousands of us home-sick ones still on the planet, and we'll have to encourage each other to live &amp; cherish the values that have cost so many generations so tremendous a price. Anyway, this world may well be, as I am persuaded to suspect, only a fragment of <em class="hi">the real world</em>.</p>
                
<p>I am able to testify daily in my columns, and I wonder why the P-D lets me go; for I say things with death in them for the whole present world-scheme. Is it possible that the P-D doesn't get my meaning? I can't believe it, for Clark McAdams is an intelligent radical. But, my god, why

    haven't they canned me before now? Quite often I hear from readers who seem glad for what I say, and, curiously enough, <em class="hi">nobody</em> ever calls me down. (I sometimes wish this might happen.) And yet St. Louis, being full of colleges and universities, must contain many who at least rate themselves as intellectuals.</p>
                
<p>I can't get the Messiah to you in time for your trip East. Have neglected to have it copied. Will do so at once &amp; be ready for you upon your return. I'll write Benet that you want to know him. Where shall I say he can reach you with a note? Answer quickly.</p>
                
<p>Comrade, quite clearly you are dealing with a fool when you deal with Pattee. I'm almost sorry I drew your attention to the fellow. It was damned selfish of me. But it would be in your proper line to call him down for his <u>general</u> incompetence, making my case only a part of the indictment. I think you <u>should</u> do this, as a man having more lights than most. But try to make it all <u>quit hurting you</u>.</p>
                
<p>Endless love, best of Comrades! I'm so glad you see too, for were you in anyway conventionally blinded, there would be so much <u>less</u> of you to love!</p>
                
<p>Anyway, your magazine is worth while. Turn loose, saying what, after careful thought, you believe. It's not time for sitting on fences. "Liberalism" is for pink teas now — more's the pity. I wish weren't but it is.</p>
