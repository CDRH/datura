      <div class="salute">Dear Master: — </div>
      
      
      	
      <p>I was delighted to hear from you again, and your generous comment on my "Friends"
         gives me courage. I will not try to tell you how much I cherish your letters. I will
         keep them for my children.
      </p>
      	
      <p>As to the rejection of "The Roamer" by Macmillans, it means nothing in the long run
         — and it is the long run that matters. You are Woodberry and "The Roamer" is "The
         Roamer". I can understand your experiencing some momentary unhappiness; but how successful
         your life has been and is! It is glorious to know that

      <p>
         
         so many have been influenced by you, and that your influence will go on and on!
      </p>
      	
      <p>I have long since ceased to look for the publisher's name when reading a book. I seek
         for the personality in the book. You see, I have been a reviewer for a dozen years
         and have read books by thousands. This is a hard time for publishers, as you know;
         and they are stripping down to those things that are commercially safe. Alas! How
         much our materialism has to answer for! And, dear Master, I sometimes feel that the
         day of reckoning is near.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Well, we who cherish the higher  values will be faithful to each other.</p>

      <p>I am looking forward to a great quiet joy when I read "The Roamer". I wish you might
         care to put your name on the fly-leaf, tho' I have not the right to ask so much. I'll give it as much space in the Minneapolis
         Journal as my editor will allow.
