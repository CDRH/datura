      <p>Bless you, Old Man, for the very generous praise of "Hugh Glass"! I now have the testimonies
         of two real poets, E. A. Robinson having written me in a highly gratifying manner.
         You &amp; he would be enough to satisfy my natural desire for approval. But the book seems
         to have gotten across in other places. The Boston Transcript gave a half page &amp; made
         its approval as decided as possible. Placed the poem above anything Masefield 
         <del class=""></del> and Noyes have done "with the possible exception of Dauber" etc etc. As to the historical
         background and general atmosphere, Doane Robinson, probably the best authority, has
         testified. I guess I'm in for the entire series now! Am beginning on "The Song of
         Three Friends".
      </p> 
      	
      <p>There are three other "Songs" beside "Hugh" and the "Friends" — all being concerned
         with the adventures of men associated in 
         <u>one</u> particular expedition. These collected will form "The Rocky Mountain Saga". Beyond this collection
         are still other collections. Within four years I should have "The Rocky Mountain Saga"
         complete; then even those who lack imagination will see what I'm trying to do! This
         information is for George Sterling, my good friend. I'm not advertising my scheme
         just yet.
      </p>

      <p>My most beautiful Xmas present came from you. The book is simply riffing! And that
         photo of you is 
         <u>just right</u>. It looks like you, both in the transient and the eternal sense. I have carefully
         pasted it inside the front cover. I have a way of showing my few highly prized books
         to visitors. Your latest has already gone into that service. Don't fear that the "Xmas
         book" venture can lower you. The work is the same exquisite stuff that is Sterlingesque;
         and it was quite proper that 
         <u>you</u> should sing the dirge of "the evanescent city", that it should be widely circulated.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I hear of your project for next Summer with interest. But when you write me that you
         have at last begun on "Lillith", as you suggested it to me, I will dance for joy.
         Because that is a great theme for you, and you will draw strange and wonderful beauties
         out of it. What exquisite word-tapestries I shall expect then! Old Man, I 
         <span class="">[own?]</span> as much of you as any other in this world, and there is a touch of true selfishness
         in my wanting you to do "Lillith". Is the idea still smouldering in you? If not, a
         little thought thereon will start the spark. The prose-poetry on California will no
         doubt feed you — leaving you free to do the long poem with no thought of selling it.

      <p>Everything goes peacefully here. I review for the Journal half the week, and the other
         half I do the real work. Have been working on a translation of 
         <u>The Agamemnon</u> — literal and in the original rhythms. Nothing of the kind has yet been done in English.
         I found that most verse translations are simply wretched. Browning's is often 
         <u>bad</u>, &amp; no one, unacquainted with Greek, could know what he means to say. He errs by out-Greeking
         Greek, very often translating the 
         <u>roots</u> of a word, not the word as the Athenians of the 5th Century understood it. Furthermore,
         he does not give the original rhythms. In the dialogue, he mistakes the iambic trimeter,
         rendering it in a nondescript 
         <del class=""></del> eleven-syllable line. I am doing this translation for the joy of it. A composer friend
         of mine will do tentative music for the choruses after the probable Greek manner and
         I expect to illustrate the volume with vase-paintings. There will doubtless be elaborate
         notes, for I find that many new &amp; plausible renderings of obscure passages are not
         only possible, but sometimes necessary.

      <p>The babies are growing fast &amp; are as healthy as pigs. Enid &amp; Sig both know "Sterlin"
         and speak of him in one breath with Tennyson, Swinburne &amp; Eugene Field! I quote your
         stuff

         to them when they come to me, begging me to "sing poetry, daddy". Why do they know
         that "sing" is quite the proper word? Enid remembers that "Uncle Sterlin" kissed her!
         And when you are gray-headed or dead, she will boast about that — as she should. My
         kids must learn early that money-makers are not great men. They must learn to honor
         high adventure whether of the mind or in the world of men. I shall give them heroes
         to honor — and that is the greatest gift to a child.

      <p>The winter's hunting has begun. Went out the other day and got a couple of jack-rabbits.
         For several years they seemed to be driven out of the country; but suddenly they reappear.
      </p> 
      	
      <p>All good luck to you, Old Man!</p>
