                <p>You don't often receive a <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="letter​ ">ltetter</a>
    ​ from me, but you should, in one way or another, receive my thoughts; they go to you every day.</p>
                
                <p>Hilda, Alice &amp; I left Branson June 14. I lectured at Wayne &amp; Chadron, &amp; we have been in camp here on Wounded Knee Creek near Ben Black Elk's place for over a month. Wonderful place to work. It goes with surprising ease. <del/> I've done my regular Post-Dispatch work &amp; have pushed the <u>Messiah</u> far along. Sitting Bull is dying now. A few more days, &amp; I'll be working on the final &amp; relatively short section -- "Wounded Knee<del>."</del>". That will be like eating dessert after a meal of many courses. <u>I'm happy</u>. The work is good. And how many years it has held me, years when I had no opportunity to go ahead!</p>
                
                <p>Now "The Song of Jed Smith" remains -- ten times as easy to do as any other, the character of it being Odyssean, a tale of adventure.</p>
                
                <p>I'm happy about the <u>Messiah</u>, &amp; had to tell you that I am. I think that glow I love to remember will come into your face now &amp; then when you read the complete poem.</p>
                
                <p>Dr. Plank of Omaha, a very distinguished Unitarian preacher, and a man of light and learning, read the MS last spring when he visited me in Branson &amp; was enthusiastic. Said it was "by far" my best. I think so in many ways.</p>
                
                <p>We will stay here nearly three weeks more. Hilda will attend the Wayne State College, &amp; we will leave her there Sept. 8th. Then Alice &amp; I will strike for home.</p>
                
                <p>I have strange things to tell you about the a<del>d</del>lleged power Black Elk "gave" me. Really hard to explain as coincidence. Too many coincidences -- forty now and more -- all in a row without a miss! I'm still the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="skeptic​ ">sceptic</a>
    ​, of course, being made so; but deep down in me <u>something knows</u>. Mona is a firm believer. We think quantitatively, hardly suspecting that reality may be wholly in the nature of the qualitative, in our crude terms. Anyway, it's a wonderful <del>i</del>universe -- all holy in some sense mostly beyond us.</p>
