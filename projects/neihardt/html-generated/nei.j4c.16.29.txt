      <p>For some reason or other my copy of your latest issue has not arrived. Anxious to
         see it.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I enclose some things that you may return on your next — this by way of sending you
         some of the news. Reviews all over the country have been surprisingly enthusiastic.
         Movie 
         <u>seems</u> a possibility. Am getting bully stuff in the 
         <u>Messiah</u>.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I wish you would make an effort to find a good medium the very next time you go to
         N. Y. Wish you were here. My friend, Dr. Schmidt, is living here now &amp; is a very remarkable
         medium when he is in shape. He would astound you in convincing ways. I feel sure.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>This, as you see, is just an interjection, but it carries the same love as always!</p>

         <br></br>Jno.

      <p>Latham is right. Sure I can get double the amount he mentions if I want it. Will sign
         contract &amp; push ahead as steadily &amp; rapidly as possible.
      </p>
      
      
      
      
      
      <p>Please return the things I enclose</p>
