      <p>I am so fond of Dr. Neihardt's 
         <u>Laureate Address</u> that I have already read up the ten copies of it. Enclosed find check for two more
         copies which I shall also read up. Before reading the Doctor's 
         <u>address</u> I was a 
         <span class="">[constantinious?]</span> reader of Shakespeare and Rev. Harold Bell Wright. Them two was my 
         <span class="">[voda mercurus?]</span>. How I find it impossibilous to read Shakespeare a tall. This I consider high praise
         indeed.
      </p>
