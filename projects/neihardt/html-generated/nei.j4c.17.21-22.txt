      <div class="salute">Dear Ben, </div>
      
      
      <p>I just heard that you broke your ankle not long ago and the news has made me write
         the letter that I thought of writing to you many times.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am very sorry to hear of your accident and I hope you are getting along well and
         will be careful not to use the ankle too soon. I wrote you a letter after returning
         home but received no reply. I am wondering if my letter reached you. By this time
         you will think that I have forgotten about the radio but I have not. This past winter
         has been a trying one in various ways and there has been plenty of excuse for not
         getting the radio ready to send to you.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>My mother died in December. She told me that she wanted me to give you the radio from
         her, and I'll see that you get it before too long.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have been working steadily on "The Song of the Messiah" and I am very happy about
         it. I think I have never done anything half as good. I do hope you will like it yourself.
         I will send you a copy when it is published in September.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Just before my mother died, my study caught fire while I was at her house and when
         I came back the whole top of my desk and everything on it was burned up. Among the
         things burned was the ms. that Joe sent me and I just haven't had the nerve to write
         him about it until now. 250 lines of "The Song of the Messiah" got burned, too, but
         I could remember the lines. I have had two nice letters from Sonny and I feel that
         he is a fine boy. His first letter reached me when I was in Omaha lecturing at a university
         and shortly after I wrote him the news of mother's death reached me and I had to start
         home.

         made the highest grades right along. The student body voted her the most scholarly
         student recently. She is a great old kid. She was home at Christmas time and I saw
         her again when I was in Omaha. She will be coming home within three weeks now.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I think of you and Ellen and the kids a whole lot and I don't think you can realize,
         Ben, how warmly I think of all of you. I have often been happy up there. I don't know
         whether I can get back this summer or not--at least not for long perhaps--as I will
         be doing some lecturing at summer schools but you can bet that I'll turn up if 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="it's​ ">its</a>
         ​ possible and we will have a good feed together like old times. Tell grandpa I think
         of him too and would like to see him again.
