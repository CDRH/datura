      <div class="salute">Dear Friend Standing Bear:- </div>
      
      
      <p>I have received the seven pictures in color of Black Elk's vision and I like them
         very much. I agreed to pay you 50¢ apiece for your pictures and I am sending you herewith
         my check for $3.50 in payment for what you have already sent me. I will pay you for
         the others as I receive them. While I am writing the book about "The Tree That Never
         Bloomed" from Enid's notes, I will see places that I think need to be illustrated
         and I will tell you about them. The rest of the pictures that you will do for me will
         be in black and white unless I should happen to find someplace that I think should
         have a colored picture, in which case I will of course tell you about it. My daughters
         and I are still enjoying the fine time we had with Black Elk and you and the others
         up there, and we are glad to have you for our friends. You will certainly see us again.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Since returning I have been thinking that it would be a good thing for me to have
         a good drum. My daughters like to sing Lakota songs and in addition to those that
         that they learned while up there, they will learn others from books that we have here,
         giving the music and the words. I am wondering if you would part with the drum you
         used during our meetings. It would mean more to me than any other one, since I would
         think of always in connection with Black Elk and you and the great stories that I
         have to tell. Write me about this.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>All three of us send affectionate thoughts to you and your wife.</p>
