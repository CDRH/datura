      <p>On Aug. 22nd, the N.Y. Eve. Post Lit. Review published my reply to the question, "what
         is the most beautiful line in English poetry". It appears also in Phila. Public Ledger.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Don't forget the opening paragraph I outlined for your Sat. Rev. article. Keep the
         article 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>toned down</u>
      </p>
      <p> well below the level of pangyric. You can say all you want to say &amp; do it in the
         lower tone. I do not say this with the least intention of criticising anything you've
         written heretofore, but merely as a precaution in

         but continue the pitch.

      <p> Did you have a chance to poke around in any representative Chicago bookstores by
         way of learning how they are stocked with the

      <p>If I could get someone to finance you for 5 yrs, you could travel the country &amp; put
         the cycle into thousands of schools. And think of the money constantly, being spent
         on bad booze! Golly! what a world. $30,000 would put the American Epic Cycle over
         with the rising generation.
