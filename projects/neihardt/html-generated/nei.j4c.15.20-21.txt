      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>It was really bully to feel the joy in your recent letter about the January Number.
         I am so glad you hit upon the very fine idea of conducti
         <del class="on">on</del>ng this magazine. It is good not only for others, but for you. I'm looking forward eagerly
         to seeing the latest issue, as I needn't tell you. I don't know that I have said enough
         about the various numbers as they have reached me, but I have rejoiced none the less,
         and the fact of your running this magazine is one of the very good things that I know.
         I can't think of a list of persons to whom I want copies sent, but I'll think of perhaps
         four or five or a half-dozen soon.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have not sent you the little booklet you wanted, because I have not been able to
         find a copy.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>Have you written to THE NATION as you said you might? I really think that not much
         of what is 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>said</u>
      </p>
      <p> nowadays really matters long. The popular consciousness is too hysterical to be much
         impressed by anything that is said. It is a matter of gratification to me, however,
         to note how many subtler indications of the living quality of the stuff I've written
         continue to turn up. Two or three things of this sort are certain to happen in any
         week and are likely to come from anywhere in the country. They take the form of requests
         for autographs, expressions of appreciation, passing references to my work as though
         they were a part of the scheme of things, and always the plane of regard seems high.
         Naturally, I don't mention these things

         to you as they happen, but if you were around here I am sure you would often have
         that glow on your face that I love to see.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I suppose you are having spring there as we are here. In fact, winter in this country
         is never really more than six weeks long. Most of the year is either early in the
         spring or late in the fall. It is a great country to live in. I wish there were some
         way for us to be closer together. While I am wishing I might as well wish that you
         could be living here and running your magazine, but of course that is only a lovely
         dream.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm definitely planning to go to the Sioux Reservation in April, and it seems that
         I may lecture at most of the state normals in Nebraska as I pass through. Dr. Conn
         wants me to do this.
