      <h3>Continuous Revelation</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <em>THOSE DISTURBING MIRACLES.</em> By Lloyd C. Douglas.  (Harpers.)
      </h4>
      
      <p>NEITHER the fundamentalist nor the dogmatic materialist will find this a pleasing
         book.  Dr. Douglas, a well-known minister here takes the not as yet overpopulated
         middle ground where, it appears, he is able to appreciate at the same time what he
         believes to be the revelations of both science and religion.  Evidently he has been
         at great pains to reconcile an elder and a younger loyalty, the conflict between which,
         in our time, so often results in the destruction of one or the other.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The question that Dr. Douglas has asked himself is the familiar one: How can Science
         and the Bible both be true?  That, he answers, depends entirely upon another question:
         Who is reading the Bible, and what is his view as to the function of Science? As to
         the Bible, Dr. Douglas says that “it requires brains to read it.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“The idea that some people entertain,” he continues, “that this hallowed book should
         be placed in every human’s hand, regardless of his years and intellectual experience,
         is based upon the erroneous belief that anybody, anywhere, at any age, may be expected
         to derive magical benefits by reading it, no matter how ignorantly.  Quite to the
         contrary, the child and the untutored adult should be taught only certain easily explained
         facts set forth by this venerable volume.  It is as indefensible to place a copy of
         the Bible in the hands of early adolescence and expect youth to deduce from it the
         present imperatives of religion, as to offer a small boy a text-book on geography
         composed of the world-maps drawn by Anaximader in the year 600 B. C.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The retort of some fundamentalists is easy to imagine.  It would run somewhat as follows:
         “If the Bible does not mean what it says, whose ‘brains’ shall we trust to expound
         it properly, since ‘brains’ of so many sorts even now expound it in so many ways?”
         If it were not un-Christian to do so, no doubt more heat might be contributed to an
         already superheated discussion by adding something cutting about the easy assumption
         as to having “brains” fit to match Jehovah’s.  Whereupon Dr. Douglas would explain
         sweetly that “Jehovah leaves a great deal to be desired” as a conception of divinity.
         This would, perhaps, not tend to promote “the peace that passeth understanding.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As to the miracles, Dr. Douglas not only rejects the literal interpretation of them,
         but undertakes to show that, literally interpreted, they can have no possible bearing
         on the problem of right living in harmony with a divine plan.  His treatment of the
         calming of the storm on the Sea of Tiberias is typical.  “As a stiller of storms on
         seas,” he writes, “Jesus has made no contribution to the world’s safety.  He has done
         nothing and does nothing to the weather or the waves or the winds.  But He did and
         does address the tempests of anxiety and fear in human hearts.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Jesus is abroad and ready to speak peace — not to the howling wind and roaring wave.
         It’s not the wind and waves that need divine attention.  It is you!  The real storm
         is inside of you.  The tempest that endangers is inside of you.  Where the great calm
         must come is inside of you!”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>By such spiritual explanations of the miracles, Dr. Douglas insists, “You haven’t
         lost your miracles; unless, of course, you are merely trying to safeguard the integrity
         of magic!”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As for the author’s attitude toward science as a partial revelation of the divine
         scheme, the following is eloquent.  “The time has come when the reappraisement of
         the conception of Deity’s dealings with mankind will attach a new responsibility to
         the endeavors of scholarly research.  Test tube and blowpipe will become invested
         with all the significance once claimed by surplice and chalice.  What is to be seen
         in the fluoroscope will be as important as anything to be seen in a stained window.
         The Bunsen burner will be as potent as the censer.”
