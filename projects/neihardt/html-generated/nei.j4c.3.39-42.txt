      <p>As was to be expected, I am delighted with "The Caged Eagle 
         <del class=""></del> and Other Poems". You fancied I "would not like some of these sonnets." You were
         mistaken. Apparently, you can't write a sonnet that I don't like. I doubt if your
         equal in the writing of that form is to be found in the world just now. Most certainly
         no one is your superior. God! What artistry is yours! I have read the volume three
         times straight through, and I have lingered long over some of the sonnets.

      <p>I do not agree with your partisan view in the war-poems. For that matter, I believe
         no strictly partisan  view can be thoroughly philosophic. Nor do I share your apparent
         belief in the peaceful future of the Race. Progress seems to me an illusion. As I
         conceive it, we do not proceed toward perfection upon an ascending straight line;
         not even upon an upward curve. I would diagram the course of Civilization like this:
         
         
         
         etc.

      <p>The height has already been reached often; often we have fallen. This is a world of
         endless struggle. If anything

         like the Ideal is ever to be attained, it will be in some spiritual existence — certainly
         not in a world where guts are so important. Of course I realize that your vision is
         more alluring to the human mind, because the goal is represented as being in sight.
         And I'm glad you make beauty out of your vision. Also, you may be right. But even
         if you are wrong, the fact remains that this is precious stuff you have given us;
         and I am  very proud to have you for my friend. I am thoroughly convinced that you
         have done some of the very finest sonnets in the language; and so I say to everyone
         who talks with me about modern poetry.

      <p>I'm sailing along nicely with "The Song of Three Friends" — the second piece of my
         epic cycle. I think it is better than "Hugh Glass". After the "Friends" there are
         two other pieces, &amp; I have six years of work laid out clearly. My collected lyrics
         will come out in September. The volume will be called "The Quest" — about 200 pages.
         Macmillans chose the title.
