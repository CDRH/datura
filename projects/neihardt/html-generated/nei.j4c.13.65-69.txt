      <p>Just a note in haste to assure you that things go finely with me. The market did not
         smash me. I had sold most things and what I hold I own outright. Naturally, if I sold
         what I have at present prices I'd be behind on that particular deal, but I'm holding
         and shall continue, since I don't need the cash. The only thing that makes me sad,
         sometimes almost desperately so, is the growing conviction that our civilization is,
         without the least exaggeration, an unmitigated fool. But I don't want to write about
         that here.

      <p>I did my stunt for the National Council of Teachers of English in K. C. on Saturday,
         and had a fine reception.

      <p>My column here is winning in a way that surprises me more than most things in my life
         have. Within the past three months the responses have been gro
      </p>
      <p>wing in number and coming from many places. Also, the attitude toward me here in the
         Post and the general attitude in St. Louis 
      </p>
      <p>are rather astonishing to me. The column, to put it briefly, is getting to be something
         of an institution. I wonder and wonder why this very decided response should

      </p>
      <p>ff just as good as I'm doing now. It has been said that my column is alone in the
         country. I can't see why the Post lets me go ahead as I do, for I say

      <p> pretty often. And I am </p>

      <p>It's queer how you feel about the MESSIAH. I think you are clairvoyant, whatever the
         explanation of that unque

      <p>
         <del class="may be">may be</del>
      </p>
      <p> of clairvoyance may be. Recently a medium here told me she saw a book </p>
      <p> - "one you have begun to write but have not completed" - "and suddenly it turns to
         almost pure gold in my hands and from it arises a purple etherialethereal that reaches
         the heavens." I myself do not believe this so far as I know, and I doubt if I am eager
         to write anything, except as I may be compelled. I don't seem to care much what the
         world thinks of me, save as what it says may mean that I am helping here and there.
         You write of the "MESSIAH" MUCH AS various mediums have spoken. (I'm not thinking
         of "spiritualism" in this connection. I suspect there's a better explanation that
         would fit the Hugh Glass country business too.) The medium mentioned added: "Man,
         I give my shoes, I'd sacrifice anything to write that book"! But damned if 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>I</u>
      </p>
      <p> can see any reason for such eagerness. Not now, anyway, though I have a haunting
         feeling that I'll surely write it. Of course, the

      <p> meaning of the poem, as I now conceive it, is to me the key meaning of all our suffering.
         I feel that meaning with an intensity that sometimes nearly lifts me off my feet.

         and felt it so deeply that I'd catch myself crying; and I'd feel ashamed. God knows
         I'm colder inside than I was when you knew me by constant contacts, and I never was
         given to tears. I hope I don't sound mushy. I tell you, I feel cold as ice most of
         the time. And I seem to want less and less of anything. Maybe I

      <p>As for getting to Branson, we're going, if for no other reason than to get away from
         the immediate vicinity of so much social insanity. Down there I could forget much.
         It has been suggested here, voluntarily, for I've said nothing that Bovard, the Czar
         of the Post, would undoubtedly let me do almost anything I might want to do. I'm not
         so sure, but I intend to try to make arrangements for my present salary in Branson.
         I could save two and a half hours a day by not having to travel, and I could use that
         for the Messiah. Anyway, we are going to Branson. Have fixed up our home there and
         made it beautiful and comfortable.

      <p>Yes, go to see Jones. Don't miss the opportunity. He is a Catholic mystic, but his
         mysticism is genuine beyond any possibility of doubt. Have him tell you of his experiences.
