      <p>If the mail clerks had more understanding I would address you
         "Sterling, Yosemite Valley" — but they wouldn't trouble, &amp; so I've got to aim this
         so that it will ricochet &amp; find you. I can't exaggerate my faith in the stuff you
         will do on that subject. It's your kind of material, &amp; you'll land something riffing.
         I rejoiced when I received your card, for I knew that you were incubating something
         big again. Go to it!

      <p>The Macmillan Company has accepted "The Song of Hugh Glass" for Fall 
         <u>publication</u>. They offered "heartiest congratulations on what seems to us a distinct achievement".
         They might have been very stiff, you know. They will issue my Selected Poems later,
         it seems.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I knew you'd help me be glad about my "Song" &amp; so I'm telling you. Write me, won't
         you? I think of you more than of any other man. And no one places you higher than
         I do.
