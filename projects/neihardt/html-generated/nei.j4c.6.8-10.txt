      <div class="salute">Dear Sterling: — </div>
      
      	
      <p>It has been a long while since I heard from you last, but many things have kept me
         from writing. Your last letter told how you had refused to become a member of the
         Institute, &amp; I rejoiced at your stand, for your reasons are good. I had thought, however,
         that the advertising value of membership might be considerable, and for that reason
         I was genuinely glad to hear that you had been selected. Of course you do not need
         the Institute; it could add nothing to you, but it makes a noise, &amp; this is a noisy
         planet.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Anyway, congratulations on your admirable display of bowels!</p>

      <p>Do you know Dhan Gopal Mukerji, the young 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Hindu​ ">Hindoo</a>
         ​ Brahmin? He spent Easter Sunday with me, and we had a fine battle!

      <p>The school edition of 
         <u>Glass</u> was sold out by Feb 1st, &amp; is only now reprinting. Rather gratifying to me! My "The
         Splendid Wayfaring" (prose) will be out for the Fall trade. Am beginning on my "Song
         of the Indian Wars".
      </p>
      	
      <p>How are you, Old Man? And do you love me just a little? I wish I could have you alone
         in some lonesome place for a day. So much to discuss concerning current tendencies!
      </p>
      	
      <p>Good luck!</p>

      <p>I'm off for a scout on several of the old Sioux &amp; Cheyenne battlefields in May. Will
         lecture at several places by way of paying expenses. Will meet some Indian-chiefsIndian chiefs &amp; scouts who have agreed to give me dope on the old heroic times. They will go to
         a big ranch out in the
