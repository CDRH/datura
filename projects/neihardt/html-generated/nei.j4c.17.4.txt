                <span class="salute">Dear Mr. McAdams:</span>
                
                <p>It was impossible to get another leader to you Friday <del>yesterday</del> morning. This did not occur to me while we were talking on the 'phone Thursday afternoon. I hope it will be possible to use the enclosed this week. I know Gottlieb will see that the proof is correct.</p>
                
                <p>I'm really sorry that the Masters article seems objectionable, but I'm sure you have good reasons. Never was a time more thoroughly bedevelled with <del/>false <del>false</del> prophets in all fields, and it seems worthwhile to help a little, whenever possible, to discredit them.</p>
                
                <p>I was serious about your dropping in here and being around with us. You'd like it, I hope, and we would, I know.</p>
                  <span class="closer">  
                    <span class="salute">Yours,</span>
