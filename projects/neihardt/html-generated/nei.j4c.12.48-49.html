      <p>Your letter came yesterday and the Notes have just now come in. I'll get at them yet
         this week and Enid will begin copying at once. I am returning the check. Of course
         this can not be at your expense. Thanks anyway.

      <p>I will have the maps you suggest and also a picture of Crazy Horse for frontispiece.</p>
      
      
      <p>I wish you would write Brown, telling him that you have about completed the Notes,
         that they will soon be in his hands, and asking when they intend to issue the school
         edition. It is quite proper that you should ask him this, since you exchanged letters
         with him on the subect.

      <p>Yesterday I received a telegram from Wellesley College, offering me $100 and expenses
         both ways to lecture there on Nov. 7. I had to turn it down. Last week I turned down
         another request for a lecture that was made by wire. I have to be in Wichita and Topeka
         in Nov. During the past year, I have turned down at least a dozen requests from various
         parts of the country. I have offered to go to Wellesley in February, and I have no
         doubt it can be arranged.

      <p>The response from those to whom I have written about the All-America Movement has
         been surprisingly enthusiastic. Dr. Kaufman of Washington wants to do an article on
         it for the

         Christian Science Monitor, which will be of enormous advantage. No better place to
         spring it. We have big men on our Board of Advisors and will have all together about
         thirty from all parts of the country. If I only had the time to work at this I could
         make a fortune easily. This is no wild saying. It's a winning scheme and can be put
         over with a bang. As it is, I have not enough zip. Still, I can pull through.

      <p>I'm interested in your Quarterly. Yes, I think you can get some good writers. If I
         can help land any special ones you have in mind, call on me. I am known well by most
         of them, and they'll listen.

      <p>Drove down to Branson Last Friday P.M. and back Sunday. Our house is a joy to look
         at. I didn't know it after all that is done. It looks like a brand new house and it
         really is. Beautiful, too. I want to live there again, and will.
