      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>Many thanks for the special delivery - also for the bully letter from you rec'd ℅
         the judge.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Finest of success at Omaha. They made me give 
         <u>two</u> complete programs in one evening.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm delighted to know that you are working again on the Book. Best of luck this time!
         I too believe in it - did before, &amp; was surprised at the publishers, tho', of course,
         I couldn't know what was in demand.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Yes, I'd like the other letters. Will go after the bunch with a will + send all back
         together.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have no suggestions as to your Guild speech on me. You'll know what to say. I wish
         I could sneak around + hear without your being aware of my presence.
      </p>

      <p>I think you are quite right about Alexander + also in what you say of the World-Herald.
         It's God damn small business, I think. I've seen + felt practically what you mention.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have not the least dread of Alexander under any circumstances. He will not act 
         <u>in my presence</u>, and, furthermore, many are on to him. I admire much in him but fear he's an envious
         man. I have many faults, but envy is not one of them. I have never envied anyone,
         being what I must be + doing what I have undertaken to do.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Alexander has praised me highly on several occasions; but my known friendliness to
         Scott + Sherman 
         <u>+</u> Avery will make a difference. Well, I'll tell anyone I like Avery. I have felt his
         warmth + essential bigness, and that's all I need.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Doctor, I've 
         <u>won now</u>, for I do not count winnings as most do. My Collected Poems is sufficient justification
         for one little man's life. I can no longer be defeated. If I have potential enemies,
         they may shoot + be damned. There is a future that will love me a little at least.
         That's sure.
      </p>
