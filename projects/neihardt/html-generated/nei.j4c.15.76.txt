      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I wish your dream about using a chapter of the book could come true, but it is impossible
         as the book was sold to William Morrow and Company last February and Morrow is absolutely
         in control of it. He is eager to get the manuscript as soon as possible so that he
         may begin preliminary publicity work. It is apparent that all the power he can summon
         will be put behind the book and he has various plans that promise much.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I am glad you have received the article from Russell. He knew Upson well and what
         you have is something at first hand. Burton ought to be willing to help and I think
         he will if you write him. You might begin your letter by asking if you may use all
         or portions of his poem on Upson, and then make the request that he help by contributing
         something on Upson.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>What you say about university men in comparison with myself can be explained partially,
         in so far as it is true, by pointing out the fact that my opportunities have been
         considerably greater than can be offered by any institution in four years. If this
         is not clear, tell me and I will make it clear.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I should not have delayed so long in sending you the books. They will go today.</p>
      
      
      <p>My Black Elk book was finished on October 21 and Enid had the manuscript complete
         within a few minutes after was through with my part. It will go to Morrow this week.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Please let me have the three books when you are through with them. They are rare copies.</p>
