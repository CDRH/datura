      <h3>The Ancient Wisdom</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <strong>The Science of Happiness</strong>. By Jean Finot. Putname.
      </h4>
      
      <p>ALL those who have considered the principles which underly the proper conduct of life
         must have remarked that the case of wisdom is curious.  First, all the essential wisdom
         of the world could be packed into a very small book that one might carry in the vest
         pocket.  Human knowledge increases with the discovery, but the sum of wisdom remains
         constant.  So far as may be determined, the last addition to it was made nearly 2,000
         years ago.  Second, the vast majority of civilized human beings are so well acquainted
         with this priceless, though small, body of truth, that it is impossible to utter a
         bit of wisdom without uttering a platitude; and if one indulges frequently in such
         utterances he will acquire a reputation for being a bore.  To put it briefly, the
         two astonishing facts regarding wisdom are: smallness of bulk and universality of
         acceptance.
      </p>
      
      <p>Wisdom may be defined as the quintessence of human experience relative to the best
         manner in which life may be conducted, with happiness in view as an end.  Why, then,
         is not everyone happy.  It is universally granted that the truly happy man is extremely
         rare — so rare that many doubt the existence of such a person.  It is a common thing
         for those who are called “worldly wise” to sneer at those who regard happiness as
         humanly possible, and philosophers, so called, have explained to us with great care
         why unhappiness is the prime condition of human existence.
      </p>
      
      <p>Is it possible that the quintessence of human experience, as distilled in the minds
         of the supreme thinkers of all time, can be misleading after all?  Or are the “worldly
         wise” in truth the worldly foolish?
      </p>
      
      <p>“It is difficult for us to have servants, palaces, millions,” writes M. Finot: “it
         is easier to drive this longing from our hearts.  When serious and thoughtful 
         <span class="">[...e?]</span> mind comes to dwell upon the things it formerly so ardently desired, it 
         <span class="">[...als?]</span> to us with a smile their emptiness.”

      <h4>Modern Superstitions Forgotten</h4>
      
      <p>We laugh now at the superstitions of old — the cause of so much unhappiness — and
         we forget our modern superstitions regarding wealth, luxury, inordinate ambition,
         etc.  This is not to be interpreted as an unfavorable comment upon luxury, wealth
         and ambition in themselves.  Wealth, for instance, is relative.  One may possess property
         sufficient to establish his reputation as a wealthy man; and if his desires still
         exceed his possession and his ability to acquire, he is poor; for he has failed to
         realize that for which he wished to be rich, and has thereby annulled his efforts.
         Whoever desires much lacks much and is poor to the extent of what he regards as his
         lack; while he who wishes for nothing that he is unable to acquire certainly is not
         poor.  In the words of the ancient Roman: “If you want to make me a poor man, you
         must first prove my cupidity.” 
      </p>
      
      <p>This definition of wealth and poverty is, of course, from the moral, not the material
         standpoint; for happiness is a moral, not a material state.  The distinction involves
         the main point in the discussion — the confusion of moral and material values.  In
         the matter of limiting one’s desires according to one’s ability to acquire and in
         keeping with one’s real needs, it is necessary to obey the injunction said to have
         been written upon the temple wall at Delphi: “Know thyself.”

      <h4>Question Finot Tries to Answer</h4>
      
      <p>This, substantially, is the question that Jean Finot undertakes to answer in his treatise
         on “The Science of Happiness.”  It is necessary to insist at once that M. Finot employs
         the term “science” in no vague, sentimental or impressionistic sense.  By science
         he means an orderly arrangement of knowledge, a correlation of carefully observed
         phenomena.
      </p>
      
      <p>As should be expected in any discussion of wisdom, he presents nothing new.  It is
         the manner in which he presents and drives home the truths that all of us glibly profess
         to believe, and that almost none of us practises, that makes his book one of great
         interest.  He tries to show that the wisdom, which we all possess in the form of maxims,
         if in no other way, is to be taken quite literally; that the laws of right living
         are as exact and matter-of-fact as, for instance, the laws that underly the successful
         culture of turnips.
      </p>
      
      <p>Naturally enough, M. Finot begins his discussion with the bald utterance of a platitude:
         Happiness is within us or nowhere.  This is likely to make everyone yawn; we all know
         “all that sort of thing” by heart; and yet the whole secret is undoubtedly there.
         Now, if happiness is to be found only within us, considering that few are happy, the
         common mistake must be in seeking happiness in exterior things.  We are unhappy chiefly
         through desiring what we cannot attain.  What then is the obviously wise thing to
         do that we may be happy?
      </p>
      
      <p>M. Finot gives the ancient answer — the answer pronounced by Socrates nearly 2,400
         years ago — the answer that Jesus put into a few sublime words — the answer that Ausonius
         and others have given — limit the desire!
      </p>

   <div class=" doublespace ">
      
      <h4>False Conceptions of Values</h4>
      
      <p>M. Finot shows how education (in its broadest sense) is conducive to unhappiness,
         in that it encourages false conceptions of relative values.  Almost universally the
         desirability of material possessions is inculcated, consciously or unconsciously,
         in the young.  External acquisition is represented, in both teaching and precept,
         as superior to the internal and imperishable wealth of personality.  Thus, from an
         early age we are prone to base our hopes of happiness upon having rather than upon
         being — a state of mind essentially insincere.  And yet — strange commentary upon
         human inconsistency — from all ages and all races and all religions and all philosophies
         comes the one cry, which is, substantially, as follows:  “Distrust the desire for
         wealth and luxurious life, for they do not produce happiness!  Develop and enjoy the
         kingdom 
         <em>within</em> you!”
      </p>
      
      <p>M. Finot devotes a chapter to Envy, which is likely to scandalize those who do not
         habitually indulge in the analysis of their own deeper motives.  He makes it rather
         plain that the desire to arouse envy is and always has been a large determining factor
         in human striving.  For what is the desire to surpass others but the desire to be
         envied?  The women who dress gorgeously, not so much for the men as for other women;
         the business men who sacrifice their lives that they may keep themselves and their
         families socially prominent; the politician who sells his self-respect that he may
         gain power and thus appear superior to his fellows, are hackneyed illustrations, but
         the list of types is to be drawn from all strata of society.  Of course, there are
         exceptions; the reader of these paragraphs may be such; but no doubt exceptions are
         rare.  The fault appears to lie in the common tendency to be more interested in what
         others think of us than in what we know to be true of ourselves.  “We blush because
         we have lost our hair and wear a wig, yet we consider it perfectly normal to lose
         our souls and to live in the souls of our neighbors, or even in the souls of men to
         whom we are otherwise indifferent.”

      <h4>Sorrow Needed for Development</h4>
      
      <p>In another chapter, M. Finot discusses sorrow, which so many of us regard as the enemy
         of happiness.  He insists that sorrow is “under the lash of a libel several millennia
         old,” and shows, what many of us profess to believe, that it is necessary to the development
         of strong character, and so — though the deduction seems a paradox — essential to
         the very establishment of happiness.  For happiness is a state of soul-balance, the
         sanity of the spirit; and sorrow, properly understood, creates sympathy, from whence
         springs generosity, which in turn may be shown to comprehend all the virtues.
      </p>
      
      <p>How then may one go about the important business of being happy?  But, what is happiness
         but soul-health, and selfishness but soul-sickness? “Genius,” writes the author, “needs
         to be admired.  Talent requires to be recognized.  Wealth desires to be envied and
         also demands homage, the principal token of its importance.  Goodness exacts nothing
         from anyone, finding its recompense in its own royalty.  Real happiness is the state
         produced by the benefit on returning to the soul of the benefactor.”
      </p>
      
      <p>The last sentence is, no doubt, worth whole libraries of factual knowledge.  It is
         an aged truth, for there is no young truth.  One may find it written large in the
         New Testament.  Almost everyone professes to accept it.  But how many of us accept
         it, just as we accept the statement that there are one hundred cents in a dollar?
      </p>
      
      <p>It is impossible to fairly represent M. Finot’s work in a brief review.  One appears
         to be giving undue praise to platitudinous moralizing.  But those who read the book
         thoughtfully will realize its tremendous power for rejuvenating the ancient wisdom
         that is in us, and for placing it upon a pratical basis.
