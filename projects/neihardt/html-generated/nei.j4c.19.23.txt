                <span class="salute">Dear Dr. Sheldon:</span>
                
                <p>I have been told that you may retire soon from your position as Secretary of the Nebraska State Historical Society. If this be true, I should like to be considered as a possible successor, and I feel that I should go directly to you with the suggestion. I realize that you have set a high standard for anyone to maintain, but at least my heart would be in the task, and I would be free to devote all my energy to it, now that my chief life-work, <u>A Cycle of the West</u>, is completed. I have been a student of Western History most of my life, and my contributions in that field are known. I should wish to be considered solely on this basis; and I should not care to be considered at all unless the suggestion meets with your favor.</p>
                
                <p>Macmillans will bring out my Cycle, complete in one volume, this year; and in recognition of the completed work I have just been elected a member of the National Institute of Arts and Letters.</p>
                
                <p>May I hear from you?</p>
