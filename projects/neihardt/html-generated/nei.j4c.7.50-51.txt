<span class="salute">Dear Mott:—</span>


<p>Hurrah and congratulations! I'm delighted to hear that you are connected with the University. You are of the sort that climbs steadily and without noise. You will go just about where you want to go. That has been my feeling since I met you.</p>

<p>It's good news that I am to appear at Des Moines, and I'm grateful to you. I'm looking forward to the Bookman article. It should do a great deal of good right now.</p>

<p>"The Song of the Indian Wars" goes ahead at a steady pace, in spite of my being obliged to get work ahead for an absence of six weeks. I now have nearly 1,600 lines, and am approaching the second battle. Fetterman is already rubbed out. Century has been after me for poetry, and it's likely they'll publish a portion of the "Wars" in the magazine during the coming year. I start from here shortly after the middle of October, and shall be gone until early in December. Shall be at Stanford on Nov. 15th. Have a number of engagements for the return trip through the Northwest and a number of going out.</p>

<p>I have just received a very cordial invitation from the National Council of Teachers of English to be present and do a stunt at the Thanksgiving session in Chicago. Sorry I can't make it, for there is a strong movement on foot to get "Glass" endorsed by the Council this winter. Will you attend any of the meetings of the Council this year? If so, you may have a chance to say something intelligent

<div class="note">The Order of Bookfellows of Chicago is bringing out my "Laureate Address" — the spiel I made at the Temple Theater Lincoln on June 18. Would you care to join the Bookfellows?</div>

about the book. I understand that the proposition will have pretty strong support, and a word from one who so well understands the thing I am doing might be just enough to win the day.</p>

<p>I wish it were not necessary from me to go on the road. I want nothing from life but the bare opportunity to complete what I have undertaken. But I find it necessary to go shekel-hunting in the winter. Of course, it's not quite the sordid business that last sentence makes it seem. I like people, and wherever I have gone they have been very good to me. Also these trips help to get the work across.<del/></p>

<p>No frost here yet. I judge that there has been some raw weather up North, for we have had a few chilly waves.</p>

<span class="salute">With all kind thoughts,</span>

<span class="salute">Yours,</span>

<p>It will probably interest you to hear that the sales of my books greatly increased last year. Macmillans seem to be making up too. With fairly good health &amp; the loyalty of my friends, I'll get through in ten years. After that nothing can hurt me much.</p>

<br/>J.N.
