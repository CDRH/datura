      <p>You dear, faithful man! I've been enjoying your cards and communications from Mexico,
         and they are still arriving. At any rate, one came only two or three days ago and
         then, your fine long letter from Washington! I did and do enjoy it!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm interested to know that you have  been reading my stuff — especially 
         <u>Cycle of the West</u> 
         <u>Poetic Values</u>. I use that entire book in my Critical Essay class, and it still impresses me with
         its ramifications of meaning.

         news that our fine Hockney mare, Lucifer's Carolyn, has a new colt, whose daddy is
         Creation's King, the top-ranking Hackney stallion in the U. S. for the past six years.
         Golly! That should be a champion! We now have five (5) colts, two American Saddle
         and the others Hackney and Hackney crosses.

      <p>We've made so many improvements since you were here — many, many — and the place is
         looking somewhat as we dreamed it.

      <p>There is some talk of my possibly going to the University of Hawai'i for a while.
         This is only possible now, but it could happen. I'd love the new experience, and so
         would Mona.

      <p>Your lady, I understand, will join you when her semester ends at Cornell. I'm sure
         she will enjoy the country. I love it. So different from our Middle West. Have you
         tried publishers lately with your book? I'd be happy to

         about their difficulties and it flows along most invitingly.

      <p>Your dear brother and I have many little talks at the noon hour — sitting in the sun,
         when it's sunny. He 
         <u>is</u> a dear good man. We're trying to get him to visit us &amp; have dinner with us. I think
         we'll succeed before long.
