      <p>Just a word. Am rushing to get away from here Oct 24, and have a sore thumb! Will
         be in your country. Sometime near Nov. 15th. We'll have a pow-wow!

      <p>Your lyric, "The Dead Captain" strikes me as being one of your very best. It's intensely
         human and bites in every line. I love it. My wife, too, likes it very much. It perfectly
         fits the case of her own family. While her father lived, money grew on trees. When
         he died, the miracle ceased. He was a real fellow, too loving to maintain his high

      <p>Old Chap, do more of the distinctly human stuff. It's a vein that you have never &amp;
         could never overwork (because of your natural artistic reticence), &amp; you have decided
         power in that direction. I love your unhuman things too; but men in general will love
         you more for the human sympathy that is in you and that you so often conceal. I don't
         mean 
         <u>mush</u>. I hate mush. Till we meet!
