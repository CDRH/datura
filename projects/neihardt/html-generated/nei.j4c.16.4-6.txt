<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:</span>
                
<p><u>Black Elk Speaks</u> will be published on Feb 18th instead of in April as first planned. It seems that Linderman has an Indian book for March 10th &amp; Morrows have decided to "get the jump" on him, as they put it. I'm eager to have you see the book. It will interest you, I think, as a student of social matters. I doubt, too, if the Indian religious consciousness has ever been so clearly revealed before — and this will mean a lot to you. Hilda, who is really uncannily intelligent seriously repeats a certain prayer of Black Elk's &amp; it gives her a great uplift. I feel the same way about it, &amp; so does Enid.

<p>Did you know that Morrow himself, who was a great friend of my work, died shortly after my MS reached N. Y.? He was waiting to get well enough to read the book in bed, when he died. There was something  between that man &amp; me, &amp; had been for ten years. We both felt this.</p>

    <p>(1) This is a footnote, as you see. In connection with this I want to add that <u>I wish more surfaces were opaque for me!</u> I think you'll know exactly what I mean.</p>
