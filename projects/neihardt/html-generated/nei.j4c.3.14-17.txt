      <p>I'm ever so grateful for the copy of "Yosemite", and I needn't tell you that I admire
         it. It has the Sterling quality. When are you going to tackle "Lillith"? There's a
         great theme for just you, and really the time has arrived when you owe it to yourself
         to work out the idea. I can't tell you how thoroughly I am convinced that you must
         do that thing, &amp; soon. It will furnish the mass to back up your briefer things. One
         must fear the attack on posterity, a cavalry charge is superb &amp; may be very effective
         in a small area; but you want the solid wall of infantry somewhere in the rear. And
         I have all the faith in the world that you can general a large body. I'm talking as
         though I owned you — and in a sense I do. Stagger them with sheer weight combined
         with skill! Do "Lillith" somewhat as you suggested it to me here.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Say, Sterling, there's a wistful sort of a lovable cuss here who is bats on 
         <u>shells</u>. He has really a very nice collection already; but I was wondering if in your rambles
         along the shore you might be able to find some unusual shells for him. He would cherish
         them especially as coming from you. It's a good chance to give pleasure
         
         
         
         to a fellow who hasn't much. What can you do about it? Half a dozen unusual shells
         would put him in the seventh heaven — or even one.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I'm going to the Markham dinner at Ann Arbor early in November. Your friend, Hyatt,
         is the instigator as you probably know already. I wish you were in 
         <span class="">[striking?]</span>  distance.

      <p>Macmillans have announced "Hugh Glass" &amp; I am now reading plate proofs.</p>
      	
      <p>Would you consider letting Macmillans issue a volume of your finest? I've been thinking
         about that a good deal of late. You'd have no difficulty in that direction, being
         so far above many they already publish. If you'd care to consider the matter, I'd
         be happy to broach the subject to Marsh, providing some of your more influential friends
         didn't do it. I couldn't do it right now, but sometime during the Winter I could.
         If this seems impertinent, charge it to my deep appreciation of Sterling.

      <p>My composer friend, Kreider—a fine chap, tried to see you at Caramel; but you were
