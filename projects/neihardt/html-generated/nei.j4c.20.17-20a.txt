                <p>It is good to hear about your children — all of them fine young people, and going places, "high-hearted with a hunger for the new". I feel deeply all you 
                    <u>say</u> of them, and <u>what can</u> <em class="hi">not</em> <u>be said</u> even more. How very worthwhile it all is!</p>
