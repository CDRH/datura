      <h3>Morbid Religiosity</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <em>SHAKEN BY THE WIND.</em>  By Ray Strachey.  (Macmillan).
      </h4>
      
      <p>THE LEATHERWOOD GOD,” by W. D. Howells, comes to mind in reading Ray Strachey’s “Shaken
         by the Wind,” since both are studies of the religious mania that swept in several
         waves through the East and down the Ohio Valley during the first half of the nineteenth
         century.  But the likeness is limited to the theme, for Strachey is in no way an imitator.
         His insight into religious fanaticism seems more profound than that of Howells; and
         this is hardly surprising, considering how much has been done in the psychology of
         religion since Howells wrote his novel.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It must be admitted that “Shaken by the Wind” is depressing and leaves a strong impression
         of ugliness.  It seems impossible that anyone should ever read the book twice, or
         even return to it; but anyone who is genuinely interested in the strange possibilities
         of human nature should consider a single reading well worth the effort, especially
         since it is evident that the author is thoroughly well informed and sincere.  He tells
         us that the letters and documents from which he has drawn his material were left to
         him by his grandmother with the injunction to publish them “when the right time was
         come.”  “Strange and fantastic as some of the happenings may seem,” says Mr. Strachey,
         they have all been paralleled and even surpassed in real life; and indeed it is my
         belief that similar extravagances continue to this day.  I hope to publish shortly
         some of the actual documents on which this novel is based.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The tale is concerned with the pitiful disintegration of character among a group of
         ignorant but normally upright villagers under the influence of a musty old coot who
         claims to be a prophet, and whose “call” to preach his insanely goatish doctrines
         must have been registered in a portion of his anatomy well south of the heart.  After
         debauching various half-wits of the neighborhood, he induces a number of sorry nuts
         to give all their worldly goods to him and to form a little community of the “sacred,”
         whose occupation is to dance and wait for the Second Coming which is said to be very
         near.  What happens in the community will serve to render intelligible the unsavory
         facts of Rasputin’s career among the ladies of the Russian court.
