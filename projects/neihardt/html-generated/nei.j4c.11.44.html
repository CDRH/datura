      <p>I've just seen your review of P.V. in The Sat.
         Rev. of Lit. 
         <u>Bully</u>! You
         certainly did it generously and I'm grateful. That
         will help a lot.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You'll be glad to hear that my stuff shows a
         very considerable increase in sales this year. 
      </p>

      </p>
      <p> went into a new
         edition in March - making three, counting the de
         luxe. The school edition of Friends-Glass 
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">44</h6>
      <h6 class="fw">-2-</h6>
      <p> made the biggest advance yet. I'm
         greatly encouraged.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>When are you going to take a vacation here in
         these beautiful hills with us? You are, of course,
         invited - 
         <u>you</u> meaning
         the family too. I have a car &amp; could show you
         around.
      </p>
