      <h3>National Religion</h3>
      
      <h4>Drake, Durant. 
         <em>Problems of Religion</em>. Houghton, $2.
      </h4>
      
      <p>THE position of a philosopher who aspires to place religion upon a purely rational
         basis is not an altogether enviable one; for he is sure to antagonize the greater
         portion of his readers.  Those who base their religion upon good oldfashioned faith
         and spiritual experience (as genuinely religions people are likely to do) can scarcely
         regard with favor the coldly scientific attitude of the higher critic who treats all
         religious beliefs impartially.  On the other hand, those who profess no religious
         belief are sure to regard the higher critic as a sophist, busying himself with preposterous
         and inconsequential ideas.  Dr. Drake would seem, at first glance, to have placed
         himself in some such position.  But we believe that a careful reading of his work
         would go far toward reconciling what are generally considered irreconcilable differences
         of opinion.
      </p>  
      
      <p>It is true that Dr. Drake is no dogmatist.  He neither attacks nor defends creeds;
         he merely examines all the evidence at his command with the avowed purpose of finding
         and cherishing that irreducible body of truth in religion which is concealed in dogma
         as corn in the husk.  To use his own words, his attitude toward religion is at once
         “warm, sympathetic, reverent and critical, openeyed, resolute to follow the truth
         wherever it lead.”
      </p>
      
      <p>His introductory chapter serves to demonstrate the importance of religion to those
         who may have arrived at the conclusion that they are far too “advanced” for religion;
         and it also makes plain, for those who are disposed to defend irrational religions
         views, why a reluctance to criticize and reconsider beliefs in the light of observation
         and experience serves to make religion vulnerable. 
      </p>
      
      <p>The main body of the book is divided into three parts.  The first deals in general
         with the origin and history of religions; the second, with the psychological aspects
         of religious experience; the third is concerned with a philosophical inquiry into
         theological systems.
      </p>
      
      <p>As a concession to his very remarkable work, Dr. Drake urges the importance of a “platform
         or covenant upon which men of good will the world over can unite for the age long
         war with sin and suffering, which it is the great mission of religion to wage.”
      </p>
      
      <p>If criticism is to be made, it might be suggested that the book is “too human” in
         its reasoning and not based largely on the clear utterances of Jesus Christ.
