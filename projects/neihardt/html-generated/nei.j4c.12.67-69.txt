      <div class="salute">Dear Comrade: </div>
      
      
      <p>I'm sending the MS of the Notes, but I'm afraid the job is too big for the time and
         attention you have to share. It will be necessary to study every line again in order
         to make sure that you have not misinterpreted. I have not the time to do this. A casual
         examination revealed several such misinterpretations. Ling 31, page 85 offers an example.
         There your note contradicts the factual statement of the text. There may not be many
         such errors, but any would be bad.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As you will see, I've made some corrections as to fact, as I expected to do; for the
         poem has a really vast background of fact with which you could not be expected to
         be familiar.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Have you the time + desire to make the notes </p>
      <p>
         <u>sure</u>
      </p>
      <p> throughout - that is, insofar as interpretation is concerned? I'll watch historical
         + geographical fact. We 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>must</u>
      </p>
      <p> get off to a good start with the poem, which is going to last long after we are through
         living. Your end of the job is more important than you may know, and I 
      </p>
      <p>
         <u>do</u>
      </p>
      <p> get

      <h6 class="fw">-2-</h6>
      <h6 class="fw">68</h6>
      <p>
         the impression here + there in the notes that the job was done hastily.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The point is, that if you can't do the job, nobody can. There are several who would
         be glad to furnish notes, but they could not have your genuine love for the stuff,
         and they wouldn't be my comrades.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I 
         <u>do</u> believe that if you can + want to concentrate on the job, the result can be made
         bully. But you would have to go over the whole thing with your attention focused on
         each front as you proceed.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you should find obvious lines explained in the notes, you would strike out such
         notes. If you should find less obvious lines unexplained, you would add notes at such
         places. All that is needed is your whole attention.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'd much rather hold up the publication of the book than to be doubtful in a matter
         of such vital importance.
      </p>

      <p>P.S. and certainly important.</p>
      
      
      <p>It is right that you should count the time you shall have spent on this job + let
         me send you a check when you're through. You should be paid at the rate of your present
         income; and I'll expect you to do this.
