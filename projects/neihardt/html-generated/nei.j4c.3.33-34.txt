<span class="salute">Dear Friend:—</span>

	<p>Mr. Kreider says the week of June 11th suits him; so if you can set a day in that week, I'll go ahead with arrangements for the recital here. Let me know. I'll send you material for an announcement in your papers a little later. It will be a treat for us.</p>
