      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. Cawein:— </div>
      
      
      <p>I am very grateful to you for your very generous response to my letter. Three of the
         books have already arrived, and I have spent some profitable hours reading in the
         "New Poems" volume. How I shall enjoy writing about your work! Have just finished
         my article on Sterling — whose muse is austere, almost unhuman. You are at the opposite
         pole in many ways; which only shows how vast is the domain of poetry. What an age
         we are in! What is wrong with those fussy people who talk so wisely about there being
         no great poets now? Nonsense! It's a great lyrical age! Isn't it? You were good to
         mention your liking for some of my stuff. Have you my latest volume, "The Stranger
         at the Gate"? If not, perhaps you might care to have one from me. I am in the same
         boat with you as to the necessity of hanging on to the shekels, and I have no copies
         on hand. But hope is perennial, and I expect to see a bit of cash sooner or later,
         and I base my offer on this hope. Also, I shall have some more of your volumes.
      </p>
