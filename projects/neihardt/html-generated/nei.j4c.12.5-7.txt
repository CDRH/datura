      <p>The title seems all right to me.</p>
      
      
      <p>I think it would be proper to quote a lyric or two, if you do not feel that it takes
         too much of the space. Try it anyway.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you think it would be an advantage to send the article, do so. I don't ask this,
         by any means. Yes, Enid would be delighted to type it, and I'd look it over for any
         little things that might slip by.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'd say that the Easter poem is a good one for quotation. I would not say anything
         in particular about the changes in the Fountain song, though you may want to state
         in passing that there have been some revisions, and you might mention the Fountain
         Song, without discussing it.

      <p>I have not read the chapter on the Law. But curiously enough, Enid, in talking about
         what she was copying, said to me that she could not understand much of it, because
         it isn't all there. Some of it begins in the middle of things and was puzzling to
         her. But she chose the chapter on Law to talk about and said "I like that one a lot".
         It struck me as odd that a kid of her age and understanding should feel that way about
         a discussion of Law by a sociologist; but it must be a pretty

      <p>I'm glad you have the satisfaction of knowing that you can return to Wayne at will.
         But I think you are right. Going back is generally bad business psychologically. Your
         leisure there is worth a mint to you, and I haven't the slightest doubt that you are
         doing a good deal to make the school better. It could hardly be otherwise. Then, too,
         there's the chance that the book may "go".
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I'm happier now than when you were here. Things go well, and I begin to hear good
         things of my column from the outside. The bosses also seem satisfied. I myself am
         not, of course; but I shall have to make a change for the sake of my work, and I should
         be glad to know that I am doing my best
         <del class=""></del> within the limitations with which I have nothing to do.

      <p>Kansas State Teachers Assn. wants me two days next Nov. That's five invitations to
         lecture in the last few weeks, - one from Florida.

      <p>Did you find any typographical errors in COLLECTED POEMS? When you do, please give
         me page and line and word. I spotted one - "good" for "goodly"
