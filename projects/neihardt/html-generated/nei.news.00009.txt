      <h3>By the Author of "Daedalus"</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <em>POSSIBLE WORLDS</em>. By J. B. S. Haldane. (Harpers.)
      </h4>
      
      <p>SINCE the appearance of his brilliant little volume, “Daedalus,” some five or six
         years ago, J. B. S. Haldane, the great biochemist of Cambridge, has been perhaps the
         most widely read speculative scientist in the world.  Anyone who enjoyed “Daedalus”
         should know why.  He is not to be classed with the “popularizers” of science, but
         he discusses scientific matters from a commonsense viewpoint and with a sense of humor
         that are far more effective than the popularizer’s art.  He does not give the impression
         of taking the layman’s ignorance into consideration; rather, he seems to be so thoroughly
         the master of what he knows and to have thought so much all around every subject he
         chooses to discuss, that he is able to present the essential idea in a simple way.
         He does not lecture; he chats familiarly with the reader, leading him into strange
         realms of fact and possibility with no apparent effort.

      <p>“Possible Worlds” is a collection of 35 papers which have appeared in various British
         and American periodicals.  They touch upon important points throughout the whole range
         of modern science and at times venture into the realms of religion and psychical research.

      <p>The title essay, which is placed near the end of the volume, represents one of Haldane’s
         characteristic flights into the nebulous regions of possibility.  It is concerned
         with what many good thinkers have regarded as the basic error in human thought, and
         should serve, here and there, to disturb the complacency with which the “objective”
         world is generally accepted as the only reality.  It is commonly assumed that our
         senses are capable of presenting enough data by which to know the world of which we
         are a part; but Haldane undertakes to construct other and very different worlds that
         could be quite as “real” as the one we accept without question.  He does this in various
         ways, showing how the “real world” would necessarily change with different sets of
         data.  For instance, he plays with the conception of a world that would result from
         data received only through the sense of hearing, and shows how an “exact science”
         might be built up with interpretations of sound vibrations alone.  He also constructs
         a possible dog’s world, in which data received through the sense of smell would be
         of major importance.

      <p>“Our only hope of understanding the universe,” writes Haldane, “is to look at it from
         as many different points of view as possible.  This is one of the reasons why the
         data of the mystical consciousness can usefully supplement those of the mind in its
         normal state.  Now, my own suspicion is that the universe is not only queerer than
         we suppose, but queerer than we CAN suppose.  I have read and heard many attempts
         at a systematic account of it, from materialism and theosophy to the Christian system
         and Kant, and I have always felt that they were much too simple.  I suspect that there
         are more things in heaven and earth than are dreamed of, or can be dreamed of, in
         any philosophy.  That is the reason why I have no philosophy myself, and must be my
         excuse for dreaming.”
