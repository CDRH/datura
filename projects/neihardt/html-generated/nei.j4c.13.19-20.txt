      <p>I am to read for Dana Hall Sunday, November 11th, Wellesley, Tuesday November 13th,
         and Boston City Club and Boston University within two or three days of these dates.
         Could I get to Boston for Sunday evening engagement if I should stop with you for
         Friday stunt?

      <p>"Quest" is being reissued this fall. I suppose "Collected Poems" finished that book,
         but it seems not. "Wars" out soon — announced.

         Here's a fine indication of progress: Easily 3/4 of the books I have to examine -
         and there are cartloads - could be given the same descriptive title - "Her Quiff,
         His Tool". It's nauseating.
