      <p>N.Y. Eve. Post has a fine display article by Katherine Lee Bates, head Dept. of English at Wellesley - a wholly appreciative
         review. Couldn't be better. 
         <u>Midland</u> has a fine page article; wholly appreciative. Both of these say just what you and
         I believe about the 
         <u>Wars.</u>
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I 
         <u>do</u> hope yours will be accepted by the Saturday Review. If, by any chance, it should
         be rejected, try at once on the St. Louis Post-Dispatch, sending it in care of Paul
         Greer, Mg. Editor.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Later I'll send you a collection of reviews. You'll get more satisfaction that way.</p>
      
      
      <p>I judge that the Midland article was done by paper.</p>

         <br></br>Jno.
          
      </div>
      
      <p>The campaign has started in a most promising manner, surely.</p>
      
      
      <p>Remember, Greer 
         <u>was</u> editor of the Bee before he climbed to his present job in St. Louis.

      <div class="note">Your review ought to go in Sat. Rev. It can not be more complementary than the Eve.
         Post article; + it's a more complete appraisal I know.
