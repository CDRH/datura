      <h3>Social Psychology</h3>
      
      <h4>By Ellwood, Charles A. 
         <em>An Introduction to Social Psychology.</em> Appleton. $2.
      </h4>
      
      
      <p>SO far, there have been three great schools of thought on social problems, differing
         fundamentally in their definitions of society.  The oldest of these bases its deductions
         upon the assumption that the social body is to be regarded as the result of agreement,
         explicit or implicit, between the individuals that compose the body.  This is “the
         contract theory” as expounded by Rousseau.  It is the theory that human institutions
         are arbitrarily produced, and that they may, therefore, be changed by mutual consent
         to suit the parties.  The obvious fault with this theory is that it presupposes human
         society to be composed entirely of normal adult individuals of high intelligence.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Another school advocates the “organic theory” of society.  This conception grew up
         as a result of the Darwinian theory and had its greatest advocate in Herbert Spencer.
         This school holds that society, instead of being an artificial construction, is merely
         the result of organic evolution.  Naturally this theory led to a sort of fatalism,
         society being regarded as the chance production of blind forces, and therefore not
         to be interfered with by men.  The laissez faire conception of economics was the result
         — a conception that has already been weighed and found wanting.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The third great school of social thought, advocating the “psychological theory” of
         society, is that to which Dr. Ellwood belongs; and his latest volume here listed expounds
         that theory.  Dr. Ellwood has undertaken to show that the psychological view of social
         life offers a scientific basis for the combination of what is true in both the organic
         and contract conceptions.  He contends that social life is a process made up essentially
         of psychic elements — interstimulation and response between individuals, “such as
         communication, suggestion, imitation, sympathy, conflict and of psychic processes
         within the individual, such as instinct, habit, feeling and intelligence.”  Thus,
         social life is to be understood and manipulated by understanding and manipulating
         the underlying traits and dispositions of men, and the influences of environment.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>There is much to indicate that social psychology will sooner or later come to be regarded
         as the supreme science; and therefore such contributions as this of Dr. Ellwood cannot
         receive too much attention.
