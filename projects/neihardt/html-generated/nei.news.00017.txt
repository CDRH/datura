      <h3>The Slaughter of Wild Game</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <em>Our Vanishing Wild Life.</em> By William T. Hornaday. Charles Scribner's Sons, New York. $1.50 net.
      </h4>
      
      
      <p>DISCUSS almost any evil, and if you are a logical thinker, it is quite probable that
         you will come at last face to face with that twentieth century idol, Profit, whose
         zealous priest is Politics.  How does this apply to a book on the preservation of
         wild life?  In this way:  Our legislators as a body are so busy dodging big financial
         issues while seeming to fight them, that they have little time, if indeed many of
         them have any inclination, to look after the general welfare.  This is not a criticism
         of any party — we have almost gotten away from parties.  It is a criticism of individual
         character debauched by selfishness.  The result of this system is incalculable waste,
         and the waste of wild life is merely incidental as compared with the waste of human
         life.  But if we are ever to emerge from the wilderness, all evils must be freely
         discussed, and we want specialists to discuss them.  Mr. Hornaday is a specialist
         on the subject he treats and the fund of information upon which he bases his protest
         is surprisingly large.

      <p>In following his account of the extinction of many species of birds, and especially
         in considering his warning anent the rapidly approaching end of many of the wild animals
         native to North America, we come upon the trail of commercialism.  Though the unsportsmanlike
         behavior of hunters, the inadequacy of game laws and the general laxity in the matter
         of enforcing some of the laws we already have, are three principal causes for the
         rapid extinction of wild game, the manufacturers of firearms are, perhaps, among the
         greatest offenders.  Attempts have been made to forbid by law the use of automatic
         guns in hunting; but there are five strong, if not good, reasons why such a law should
         not be passed; all are the same, though each has a separate name: the Winchester,
         the Remington, the Marlin, the Stevens, the Union Fire Arms companies.  These five
         companies put out every year over one hundred thousand automatic guns, the efficiency
         of which is ten times that of the old-fashioned single-barrel affair.  Considering
         this in connection with the fact that a million and a half hunting licenses were issued
         in the United States last year, it is easy to see that Mr. Hornaday has a very good
         talking point.

      <p>As an indication of the carelessness and lack of forethought shown by our nation,
         the author gives the following excerpt from the report of a select committee of the
         senate of Ohio in 1857, on a bill proposed to protect the passenger pigeon:
      </p>
      
      
      <p>“The passenger pigeon needs no protection.  Wonderfully prolific, having the forests
         of the north as its breeding grounds, it is here today and elsewhere tomorrow, and
         no ordinary destruction can lessen the species.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The passenger pigeon no longer exists.</p>
      
      
      <p>Mr. Hornaday offers suggestions for the modification of existing game laws and makes
         a strong plea to the individual sportsman.  The book is unique in its field and deserves
         wide attention
