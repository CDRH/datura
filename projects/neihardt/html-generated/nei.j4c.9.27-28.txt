      <div class="salute">Mr. Masters:- </div>
      
      
      
      <p>When Judge Vinsonhaler was on the point of leaving here, he received a letter from
         Long asking if he would be willing to explain my epic scheme to the audience in advance
         of my reading from the WARS. This, of course, subject to your desire in the matter.
         Judge showed me the letter and asked what I thought: Naturally, at first, I favored
         the idea, for I have a strong feeling for the Judge. I promised to send him the proper
         data; but upon setting about to do this, I was struck with the clumsiness of such
         a procedure. I feel now that I should make the explanation myself, as I have done
         a great many time, and I have written the Judge to this effect. He was willing to
         make the explanation, if I wished it so, but was not eager. I explain this so that
         there may be no misunderstanding among us.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>I have no legible manuscript of the WARS, and proofs have not yet reached me. I'm
         sorry.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Mrs. Masters' MIDLAND story is on my desk, and I am grateful to her for sending it.
         I will read it very soon. I have her kind letter also. Tell her that I can not hope
         to "intoxicate" my audience by reading a small portion of the WARS. The mood of the
         whole is the important thing. Still, when I read two days at the University, the response
         was well above the average, and it was better on the second day than on the first.
         When I spoke of having been "drunk with the WARS for four and a half years", I took
         into account the fact that the whole constructive dream was with my always. It can
         not be with any audience. When I feel the necessity of entertaining

         a crowd and making it yawp its approval, I always read lyrics and the little drama.
         They always come across. But I have come to regard that program as rather a trick
         stunt, deliberately planned what little I know of crowd thinking. Readings from the
         WARS always gain excellent attention and often arouse enthusiasm. But it is not possible
         to get an immediate effect with the epic as is possible with the lyric. I need not
         explain this to you.
         
      </p>
      
      <p>Should I read one battle from the WARS? And perhaps some lyrics afterwards, if the
         crowd seems kind?
