      <div class="salute">Dear Davis:— </div>
      
      	
      <p>I am glad to learn that Bigelow is the right sort,
         and I feel that you are a good judge of the breed of men, being
         a Westerner and naturally having that sort of a big heart which
         beats in vast spaces. I surely want to meet Bigelow. I have
         it from another friend that he is a remarkable man.
      </p>
      	
      <p>It will be easy for me to like all these fellows, if they
         can only like me.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Glad to hear that Richard Duffy is now on the Munsey staff.
         He was friendly to me when he was with Watson's.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I am hoping that "The Alien" may appear soon — before
         March first, or not later than that. It is quite necessary
         that it be a part of my short story volume. You may be sure
         that Munsey's will get the proper credit.
      </p>
      	
      <p>The American Magazine is quite apt to print one or two
         of the stories which have not been sold. "Nature and Zephyr
         Recontre", the story which you liked but considered unsuitable
         for Munsey, may be printed in the American within the next
         three months. Phillips has been kind enough to take considerable
         interest in the stories.
