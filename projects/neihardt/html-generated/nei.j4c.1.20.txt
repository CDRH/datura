      <div class="salute">My dear Davis:— </div>
      
      
      
      <p>I have your bully letter with reference to the 
         Spectrum story and the poem which was written to that Prince,
         Streamer. As to the poem, if Mr. Streamer is willing that it
         be published — let 'er go! Could you somehow tack his name to
         it? And (as a minor consideration) I need the money! My feeling
         for Streamer is such that the poem in question is sacred to me,
         but if he has given his permission, I'd be glad to let you use
         it. You are right, the man is a bully good fellow. O I'm
         finding a lot of good fellows, and you are certainly in the list.
      </p>
      	
      <p>
         <u>Although</u> —
      </p>
      	
      <p>You 
         <u>do</u> throw wicked brick-bats my way now and then!
         There's the "Mignon" letter. Just today I wrote you a reply
         to that letter, and to show you that I keep nothing back from
         a friend, I shall mail it with this. If I thought you were
         a pin-headed person, I should hold the letter back. But
         I send it. I want you to see why I don't believe what you said
         about my dear wanton little girl, Mignon. File the letter
         away among the archives of friendship, and let's not go at
         each other with axes any more. You thrust and draw blood —
         I parry — is not honor satisfied? Put up the foils!
      </p>
      	
      <p>As to the "Spectrum", I think it one of my best bits of
         writing, but can readily see why you don't use it. And I must
         add that your cleverness is not wasted on me. I enjoy your thrusts.
         That's the kind of a fellow I am.
      </p>
      	
      <p>You may be sure that I shall give you the opportunity to
         show me these things that Streamer never saw, when I get back
         there — which will doubtless be this winter. I'll go anywhere
         with you but to a Baptist church.
      </p>
      	
      <p>I am very glad that you met Streamer; it's good to know
         him. I shall make a similar statement to Streamer.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Hope you can meet Louis Ledoux one of these times. He is one
         of my bully good friends. Do what you can for his Garden of Youth.
      </p>
