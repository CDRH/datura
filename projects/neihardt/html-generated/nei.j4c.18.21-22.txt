      Mr. and Mrs. Elmer E. Holm
      Mariaville, Nebraska.
      
      
      
      <div class="salute">Dear friends: </div>
      
      
      <p>I'm returning the MS at last and I beg you to forgive my delay. Mona has sent you
         some material, and so has Sigurd. The former may suggest some corrections and possible
         additions. I have marked errors throughout and made suggestions.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You ask what prompted me to write "Beyond the Spectrum". I have always been deeply
         interested in what I now call "the otherness of things", and my interest is far more
         pronounced now than formerly. - being greater, I think, than my interest in this world
         of sense.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>"The Ghostly Brother" has a profound meaning in my life. The dream or vision to which
         it refers has continued to influence me and is growing stronger. Traces of it are
         to be found scattered through my work. I have used pentameter because, for sustained
         narrative, it best suits the genius of the English language as hexameter suited that
         of the Greek. The rhyme is never forced, and when the verse is read as written, the
         rhymes seem incidental. My verse method in handling rhymed pentameter is essentially
         that of blank verse. The unit is not the line ending in a rhyme, as I write it. The
         unit is the 
         <u>breathing length</u>, determined by the handling of caesuras (pauses). Some very simple people have leaped
         to the conclusion that I write in couplets. I doubt if there are 
         
         <u>five</u> couplets in 15,000 lines.
      </p>

      <p>Greek and Latin have influenced me only as forgotten beefsteak influences the physical
         body. There is 
         <u>no</u> direct influence at all -but I was richly nourished.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>If you 
         <u>have</u> to say something about my athletic stunts, the following is true: While in Bancroft
         I developed by years of training a chest expansion of 10 inches; lifted 125 lbs. (my
         weight) from floor over my head with one hand; tore a new pack of cards in two with
         my hands; was a good enough wrestler to mix with most men of around 160 lbs; and had
         for some time the highest score in the county on the striking machine.
