<span class="salute">My dear Mrs.Filsinger: --</span>

	<p>Indeed I shall be glad to see your new book,<a href="../doc/n01" class="internal_link">1</a>
and will want to review it, naturally. -- May I see your hand-
writing on the fly-leaf?</p>
	<p>Allow me to congratulate you,  both as woman and 
poet, upon being so happily married. Some women poets are killed
by marriage -- and should be. You will merely learn &amp; your art will
grow; because you will know how to be a woman first.</p>
	<p>The Macmillans are bringing out my "Song of
Hugh Glass," an epic narrative of the Northwest -- my country.
This is the first of a series of Northwest Sagas celebrating the
half-forgotten heroes of the American Fur Trade. The field has
never been touched before by a poet. I am now beginning the 
second -- "The Song of Three Friends." However, do not mention
the latter title. Later, the same company will issue my Selected
Lyrics.</p>
	<p>While I'm at it, may I ask how much you have
interested yourself in Greek? Tell me that you are up to the
ears in it, and gratify me! Nothing equals it for the enrich-
ment of personality. How wonderful their verse is! What masters
of the epithet -- the test of the poet! No, no, there have been
no translations. Even Browning failed, as I can very easily
prove. One must go to the fountain for that water; it can not
be piped to one's house, even in this ingenious age. And then --
once having got at the Greek itself, one can not thereafter fall

into the trap of impressionism which is set everywhere now.</p>
	<p>Well, good luck always!</p>
	<p>My wife was glad to be remembered, and joins with me in all
good wishes for both of you there.</p>
