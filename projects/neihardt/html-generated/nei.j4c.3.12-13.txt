      <div class="salute">My dear Mrs.Filsinger: -- </div>
      
      	
      <p>Indeed I shall be glad to see your new book, 
         <a id="refn01" class="inlinenote" href="#noten01">[note 1]</a> 
         and will want to review it, naturally. -- May I see your hand-
         writing on the fly-leaf?
      </p>
      	
      <p>Allow me to congratulate you,  both as woman and 
         poet, upon being so happily married. Some women poets are killed
         by marriage -- and should be. You will merely learn &amp; your art will
         grow; because you will know how to be a woman first.

      <p>The Macmillans are bringing out my "Song of
         Hugh Glass," an epic narrative of the Northwest -- my country.
         This is the first of a series of Northwest Sagas celebrating the
         half-forgotten heroes of the American Fur Trade. The field has
         never been touched before by a poet. I am now beginning the 
         second -- "The Song of Three Friends." However, do not mention
         the latter title. Later, the same company will issue my Selected
         Lyrics.
      </p>
      	
      <p>While I'm at it, may I ask how much you have
         interested yourself in Greek? Tell me that you are up to the
         ears in it, and gratify me! Nothing equals it for the enrich-
         ment of personality. How wonderful their verse is! What masters
         of the epithet -- the test of the poet! No, no, there have been
         no translations. Even Browning failed, as I can very easily
         prove. One must go to the fountain for that water; it can not
         be piped to one's house, even in this ingenious age. And then --
         once having got at the Greek itself, one can not thereafter fall

         into the trap of impressionism which is set everywhere now.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Well, good luck always!</p>
      	
      <p>My wife was glad to be remembered, and joins with me in all
         good wishes for both of you there.
