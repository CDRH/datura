      <div class="salute">My dear Sir:- </div>
      
      
      
      <p>In your letter of May 1st replying to my request for permission to hold meetings with
         the 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Oglala​ ">Ogalala</a>
         ​  Sioux, you stated that you would like to have a short report of my doings on the
         reservation and I am complying with your request.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>In company with my two daughters, I spent four weeks among the 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Oglala​ ">Ogalala</a>
         ​ Sioux in the Wounded Knee district of the Pine Ridge Reservation, my purpose being
         to get the life story of Black Elk, an 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Oglala​ ">Ogalala</a>
         ​  medicine man. In order to make the story complete, I had a number of other old-time
         Indians, friends of Black Elk, with me most of the time. The meetings, which were
         practically continuous during the entire period save for the time when we were either
         sleeping or feasting were very successful indeed and I was able to procure some very
         valuable material that has never before been given to white men. I cannot, of course,
         in a letter give you any conception of what this material is, but it would give me
         pleasure to send you a copy of my book when it appears early next spring. With the
         permission of Mr. Courtright, who showed a willingness to help me in everything, I
         had a big feast for all the people in that portion of the reservation and a big dance
         afterward in the old manner. It was not show stuff, but the old thing and my daughters
         and I did not feel ourselves to be strangers. For the feast I had a bull killed and
         nothing was left but the hoofs and horns, and later on the hoofs were eaten too. We
         were taken into the tribe with the usual impressive ceremony and given names, I myself
         being called Flaming Rainbow. If you should ever do me the honor of reading the book
         that I shall publish, the intended significance of the name will appear.
      </p>

      <p>As you, of course, already know, the 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Oglalas​ ">Ogalalas</a>
         ​ are hardly a happy or a prosperous people and those who fancy that they could be
         made so through political reforms and by measly "practical" measures, do not understand
         the Indian consciousness. I did not go there in a criticizing spirit nor did I come
         away in any such mood. While I was among the old men and feeling deeply the profound
         spirituality of which they are capable, funny as this may seem to one who does not
         know Indians well, I had a dream of what might be done for these 
         <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="Oglalas​ ">Ogalalas</a>
         ​ if the effort could be made. The simple fact about them is that they cannot be turned
         into white men and as a people they cannot be supervised successfully after our fashion.
         They are visionary, lively, and improvident for very good reasons. One feels that
         they as a people have lost their self-respect and that the only way they could be
         made really happy and prosperous would be through some revival of their own courageousness and their own religion. Incidentally, they had the courageousness and the
         spirit both and in the course of this study they are indeed seen to be admirable.
         There were times when I felt very humble before these old men, and especially when
         Black Elk, who is in spirit a great poet, was describing the great vision upon which
         his whole life has been based. What a pity it seems that these people, who are living
         now in what amounts to a social vacuum, could not be encouraged to revive and cherish
         their ancient culture to the end that they might develop a proud self-consciousness
         as a people and thus give them some incentive for striving to the end that their arid
         and _____________ acres should be fruitful. I know that this is a dream for the reason
         that the modern world would not allow it, but it is not so foolish as it may sound.

      <p>Incidentally, I may say that this was not, by any means, my first contact with Indians.
         I spent years in intimate contact with the Omahas when their old men were still living
         and am acquainted with some other tribes.
