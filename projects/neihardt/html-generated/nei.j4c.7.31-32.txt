      <div class="salute">Dear Mott:— </div>
      
      
      <p>The coronation ceremony at Lincoln on June 18th was certainly a tremendous success.
         I have been before a number of enthustiastic audiences, but I never before experienced
         so much enthusiasm. I spoke twice and read twice, reaching many kinds of people, from
         the university crowd to the idle rich, and the response was rather astonishing. I
         can't exactly explain it. Few had ever seen me before, and I certainly didn't make
         any effort to be effective. I just went at them sincerely and they did the rest. The
         ceremony itself was very dignified — just the sort that friends of my work would want
         it to be — nothing spectacular or cheap about it; and the crowd was bully. I gave
         my lecture on Poetry and Education. I enclose a letter from a friend of mine in Oklahoma
         who 
         <del class=""></del> received reports from a number of sources. You will note what he says about the lecture. I heard this from a number of sources before I left Lincoln. Whether
         it is true or not that the lecture was as good as they say, at least this was being
         said generally at the university. The editor of the State-Journal wrote about the
         whole affair to the Neihardt Club with headquarters in Wayne, and his letter ended
         in this way: "Neihardt won his way farther in thirty hours than any other Lincoln
         visitor I have ever known". Before I left, a committee from the University waited
         on me and asked if I would consider living in Lincoln for a salary and no duties.
         I have since heard that the call is certain to be made.

      <p>Please do not think that I tell you these things by way of throwing bouquets at myself.
         
         <em>The idea is to let you know how the affair went off</em>, for you are one of my strongest aids, and it is necessary that you should know about
         this affair.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I enclose one clipping. The Lincoln papers were very liberal with their space, and
         much was written about the enthusiasm and the "profound" effect, and all that. I have
         only this one article on hand.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I note by the N. Y. Eve. Post that the Grinnell Review carried some comment on the
         Laureateship — doubtless the comment was yours. I have not seen the article. If it
         was from you, I needn't say that I am grateful. You know how I feel about those who
         help my work.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I have been surprised at the wide-spread approval of Nebraska's action. There has
         been very little flippant comment. I understand that Review of Reviews, Current Opinion
         and Lit. Digest will have stuff on the coronation. I hate that word, "coronation".
         The State Journal very sensibly called it "official notification". That's far better.
