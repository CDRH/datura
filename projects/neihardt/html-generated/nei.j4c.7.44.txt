      <div class="salute">Dear Seymour:— </div>
      
      
      
      
      <p>I was glad to get your card from Colorado, and appreciated your thought of me.</p>
      
      
      <p>No doubt you are now back from your vacation. Since hearing from you last I have sent
         on the proofs of the PACK and also the MS of my Address. I am wondering if the latter
         will be in proofs before the middle of October. That is when I begin my trip to the
         Coast, and I'd like to have some copy of the address with me when I go. I have two
         of the brief speeches that I would like to run with the address. The other will be
         on hand soon; then I will send all to you. This supplementary matter will not take
         much space and can be sent in with galley proofs.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>How about the PACK? Has Trombley sent on his Columbus poem? I think it could well
         be included in the anthology. Did you receive the Sterling poems (three) that I sent
         you?
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Good luck in everything!</p>
