<span class="salute">Dear Seymour:—</span>



<p>I was glad to get your card from Colorado, and appreciated your thought of me.</p>

<p>No doubt you are now back from your vacation. Since hearing from you last I have sent on the proofs of the PACK and also the MS of my Address. I am wondering if the latter will be in proofs before the middle of October. That is when I begin my trip to the Coast, and I'd like to have some copy of the address with me when I go. I have two of the brief speeches that I would like to run with the address. The other will be on hand soon; then I will send all to you. This supplementary matter will not take much space and can be sent in with galley proofs.</p>

<p>How about the PACK? Has Trombley sent on his Columbus poem? I think it could well be included in the anthology. Did you receive the Sterling poems (three) that I sent you?</p>

<p>Good luck in everything!</p>

<span class="salute">Yours,</span>

<br/>Jno. Neihardt
