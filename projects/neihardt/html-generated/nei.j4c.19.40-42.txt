      <div class="salute">Dear Geo. Steele: </div>
      
      
      <p>I promise to  be good from now on — so don't scold me anymore! The fact is that Mona
         and I are happy to know that our "honey-haired brat" can be with Mrs. Seymour and
         you. She loves to be with you, and your several ears must have burned pleasantly while
         she was visiting with us recently. We only hope that she can find something to do
         for you. Bless your good hearts!
      </p>
      
      
      <p>You must have seen the "Admiral" by now, and a fine dear man he is! Soon he will be
         coming over to see us and make his report, for he must be "back on the ship" by now.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As you've heard, I'm flirting with the idea of finding a job in Chicago. I do greatly
         appreciate your approaching the Tribune for me, but I fear they cannot use me. Papers
         are running short-handed in the departments where I could be useful. I've felt them
         out

      <p> over a wide area — and everywhere it is the same. What they all need is young reporters
         and occasionally desk men. Atho' my vision is good, my eyes will

         no longer stand steady reading all day. I've read such hills of books.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I've wondered if I might not get on a weekly or monthly publication. I've handled
         a mass of MS, and know how. I'm really 
         <u>good</u>! Some time back, according to Hiddy, there was a call for an editorial worker on
         a medical magazine, &amp; one with some Greek &amp; Latin would have been especially acceptable.
         I could have handled that nicely. I could and would handle commercial house-publications.
         There are business jobs I could handle too, for I spent some years in business offices.
         I'd rather  
         <u>not</u> have to write for a living.

      <p>Macmillans are now pushing ahead with the manufacturing of the one-volume  
         
         <u>Cycle of the West</u>, and Latham  
         <u>does</u> seem to have enthusiasm. I've just written the Introduction, and must now prepare
         the map of the whole country between the Missouri and the Pacific. Here is where Mona
         comes in with lettering.

      <p>Amama is here, and we're happy together as before. She's a good girl when she doesn't

         cry about the war. When she does, she's naughty and we become very stern with her!
         But mostly she's a pretty good girl, and we hope to raise her in the way she should
         go. Christian influence, and all that. A highly moral atmosphere and firm discipline.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I haven't written you for ages, but I'm making up for it now. You'll admit this is
         a lovely letter.
