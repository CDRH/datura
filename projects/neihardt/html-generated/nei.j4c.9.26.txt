                    <span class="salute">Dear Seymour:-</span>
                

                <p>The packet of books has not yet reached the house, but I am waiting breathlessly <del/>with pen in hand. I need practice anyway, as I shall have to sign a thousand copies of the <a rel="tooltip" class="sic" title="deluxe​ "><u>de luxe</u></a>
    ​ edition of the WAR between now and middle January.
</p>
<p>Listen! Are you there?</p>

<p>Well, I've just gotten Macmillans to agree to pay a larger royalty than they offered for my Collected Poems, to be issued in the fall of '25. I used to be afraid to say anything in my own interest; but I'm over forty, and one changes. They propose to reset all my poetry for the Collected Edition and make a fine book. 750 pages!
</p>
<p>That is really bully news about Mrs. Seymour's book on the Indian, and I'm glad Macmillans are to have it. I <u>shall</u> look forward to that book; I mean that I shall look forward to reading it. So often that sort of thing is just said to be agreeable. As Allen True wrote me recently: "Kindest regards and all that sort of bally-rot!"
</p>
<p>Many thanks for the Little Blue Book by Mrs. Seymour. I'll devour that tonight after the family is planted up stairs.
</p>

    <span class="salute">Yours always,</span>
    <br/>Jno. Neihardt

<p>Should I try to fatten up a bit for that banquet? Piece de resistance! Roasted? Or pickled?
