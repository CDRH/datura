<h3>Space Felt as Time</h3>
<h3><em class="hi">RACING THE MOON (AND WINNING).</em> By John Henry Mears. (Henckle.)</h3>
<p><span class="unclear ">[CONSIDERING?]</span> what human val-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> grow out of social contacts<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> that the brute fact of dis-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> was from the beginning the impediment to the making of<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> contacts, it is probable that<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> important fundamental<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> to our present conception <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> world is that by which the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> of distance is being trans-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> from the category of space <span class="unclear ">[to that?]</span> of time.  The first circum-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> of the globe was con-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> wholly with the space con-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Time did not count, for <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> was a matter of managing <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> to complete the journey <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> and the planet.</p>
    
<p>When the late Joseph Pulitzer <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Nellie Bly around the world <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> at the imaginary record of the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Mr. Fogg by eight days, <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> something far more important than <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> sensational news story was in the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span>  In 1890, George Francis <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> cut five more days from the <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Eleven years afterward, Charles Fitzmorris later Chicago’s Chief of Police, lowered the record <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> a week.  In 1907 Col. Burnley <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Campbell made the trip in 54 days, <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> to the Trans-Siberian Railroad, then recently opened to traf-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> In 1913 the record stood at <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> days, 19 hours, until John <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Mears lowered it to 35 <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Thirteen years passed.  Then <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Wells and Edward Evans <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> <span class="unclear ">[managed?]</span> to cut nearly a week from <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> time, and thereby hangs the thrilling tale that is told in the volume here noted.</p>
    
<p>Mears, unwilling to accept <span class="unclear ">[defeat?]</span> decided immediately upon <span class="unclear ">[another?]</span> effort, and for the greater <span class="unclear ">[part?]</span> of the next two years he was <span class="unclear ">[engaged?]</span> in arranging the many <span class="unclear ">[details?]</span> which resulted in his success <span class="unclear ">[this past?]</span> July.  This time, however, <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> inspired by a far more ex-<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> <span class="unclear ">[ive?]</span> idea than that of beating<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> man.  He would run a race<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> no less august a contestant <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> the moon herself, who, for <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> millions of years, has been managing the trip regularly in about<span class="unclear ">[?]</span> weeks.  As many will <span class="unclear ">[remember?]</span> in spite of the fact that six <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> ago is almost ancient <span class="unclear ">[history?]</span> these times, the celestial <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> <span class="unclear ">[nted?]</span> under the wire five <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> too late for the money.</p>

<p><span class="unclear ">[?]</span> stirring a marvelous tale <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Mr. Mears has to tell of his <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> <span class="unclear ">[rush?]</span> around the planet with <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> late lamented Capt. Collyer, <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> one of the pluckiest fliers <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> ever handed a joy stick, and <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> dog, “Tail Wind.” who <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> <span class="unclear ">[contributed?]</span> far more than his <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> to the adventure.  There <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> moments in the narrative of <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> five-day flight across Europe <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> Asia that take one’s breath—<span class="unclear ">[?]</span>blind fight with the storm <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> the Ural crags, the crossing <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> lonely Siberian Wastes in <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> clinging twilight of high <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> the two-mile-a-minute <span class="unclear ">[?]</span> the Gobi Desert and Baikal, the desperate groping in the fog by night for Yokohama, found barely in the nick of time.</p>
    
<p>“Racing the Moon” is a book worth reading, and after enjoying it one might well lay it away for reference in that time when men shall girdle the planet at thrice the lunar pace.  Considering the performance of the tri-motored Fokker, “Question Mark,”  that exploit may not be far off.
