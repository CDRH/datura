      <h3>WAR AND SOCIETY</h3>
      
      <h4>Nasmyth, George.  Social Progress and the Darwinian Theory.  Putnams.  $1.50.</h4>
      
      <p>IT IS the contention of Dr. Nasmyth that the philosophy of force is the real cause
         of "the breakdown of civilization" in Europe; and his purpose is to show from whence
         sprang this philosophy and how it came to dominate the modern world, as it undoubtedly
         does.
      </p>
      
      <p>What is the philosophy of force?  It is, Dr. Nasmyth tells us, the belief that human
         progress is the result of natural selection operating in the social realm through
         the agency of war.  The theory has been eloquently expounded, not only by such men
         as Nietzsche, Von Moltke, Bernhardi and Theodore Roosevelt, but also by such men as
         Herbert Spencer, Ernest Renan and Ruskin.  The source of the theory, we are told,
         is to be in the misconception of the Darwinian theory of evolution, due to an illogical
         application of definite biological analogies to human society.  It is Dr. Nasmyth's
         chief purpose to show that Darwin himself did not push his theory so far, and that
         the struggle by which mankind has advanced was the struggle of man against the external
         universe, and not of man with man and social group with social group.  Without a doubt,
         this point is well sustained by the author, and for that reason alone, if for no other,
         the volume should have the careful attention of thinkers.
      </p>
      
      <p>It would seem, however, that Dr. Nasmyth, after successfully confounding those who
         defend the philosophy of force on the grounds of biological evolution, proceeds to
         push his own contention too far.  No one can doubt that modern militarism, reaching
         its maximum development in imperial Germany, is truly the result of a misapprehension
         of the Darwinian theory.  Nor can one doubt, as Dr. Nasmyth states, that the geographical
         position of Germany and the Franco Prussian war were largely responsible for the practical
         application of the theory by the German empire.  This much seems clear.  But we begin
         to question Dr. Nasmyth's argument when he makes this philosophy of force the cause
         of all modern social ills.
      </p>
      
      <p>The present war is not, as is generally supposed, of dynastic, but of commercial origin;
         and it is to the same source that the ills of society must be traced, and to nothing
         else.  The philosophy of force, far from being the cause of modern social ills, is,
         in fact, merely the technic of world competition for markets, and quite properly so;
         for competition, however veiled by custom, is a form of violence.
      </p>
      
      <p>Dr. Nasmyth himself seems to suspect something of the kind in his later chapters,
         although he still maintains that the philosophy of force is a cause, and not, as it
         seems to us, a logical result of the social disease.  He makes a strong and, at times,
         convincing plea for the establishment of a world federation in the interest of universal
         peace; and since it is undeniable that society tends more and more toward the larger
         unit, his argument is of great significance.  But he does not seem to grasp the fact
         that only by destroying our present competitive system of economics and instituting
         universal co-operation could his dream become a reality.
