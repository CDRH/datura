      <h3>A Suggestive Fantasia</h3>
      
      <h4>
         <em>THE MAN WHO WAS BORN AGAIN.</em> By Paul Busson. (John Day Co.)
      </h4>
      
      <p>THERE are reasons for suspecting that the number of people who are interested in so-called
         small subjects is on the increase.  [ ? ] is spite of the growing tyranny of the materialistic
         conception of the world, but because of it.  It is only the highly intellectualized
         personality that can bear the painful rationalities of life without groping for mysterious
         avenues of escape.  Intellectual attempts at [ ? ] generally take the form of [ ?
         ] negation — a fact that even from the pragmatic viewpoint of the intellectual is
         hardly in his favor, since men must continue to [ ? ].
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It is easy to see why Paul Busson’s fantastic novel, “The Man Who Was Born Again,”
         should have taken hold in Germany as it is said to have done.  It first appeared five
         years ago when the horrors of war were still vivid and the worldy hope must have seemed
         futile to the vast majority. Busson’s novel is compounded of the two ingredients most
         likely to be affective — the apparently insane brutalism of life in certain conspicuous
         phases and the alluring hope of a literal spiritual escape into a better world. 
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The curious tale concerns one Sennon Vorauf, a German of our century who has come
         to remember all the details of his former life as Baron Melchier von Dronte who lived
         in the eighteenth century.  The greater portion of the story is told in the person
         of the eighteenth century Baron, and it is a tale of life lived largely under the
         spell of brutal illusions with occasional gleams of a super-brutal vision that triumphs
         at last.  It is a picturesque tale, ranging from the sordid to the horrible, but curiously
         shot through with flashes of tenderness and beauty, prophetic of the change that is
         to be.  Von Dronte, a spoiled young aristocrat, goes to the devil, is disinherited
         by his father and having murdered a companion in a drunken brawl, by way of saving
         his neck enlists as a private in the Prussian army.  Reaching the lowest depths of
         misery and degradation; he deserts and becomes a wandering outcast. The spirit of
         a youthful sweetheart, long dead, and a mysterious presence, that appears at critical
         mo-ments, lead the broken wastrel slowly to a realization of his blindness; and by
         the time he finds himself about to be guillotined in Paris during the Reign of Terror,
         he is spiritually cleansed and ready for the great change.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>As the knife falls, a wonderful thing happens.  “Then it was night — a rush of air
         — the noise of wind — a painful rending asunder ⁸ a thread cut in twain — I was outside
         my body.  Nothing was concealed from me, neither below nor above. The wind blew through
         me, the rain fell through me.  I had none of the qualities that are inherent in the
         things of space.  I was large and small, inside and outside, far and near.”
      </p>
      
      
      <p>A passionate quest begins.  The spirit that had been called Von Dronte is seeking
         a new father and mother; and at last in a lightning flash of ecstacy the divine miracle
         of a new incarnation occurs.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Von Dronte re-awakens to life in the flesh as Sennon Vorauf.</p>
      
      
      <p>As will have been noted, “The Man Who Was Born Again” is a highly original tale, and,
         though fantastic to the point of madness at times, there are moments of vision in
         it that make one wonder.
      </p> 
      
      
      <p>Paul Busson was born in 1873.  After studying medicine for four years he entered the
         Austrian army, serving four years as Lieutenant.  For some years thereafter he lived
         in Asia Minor.  He died in 1924.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>It is probable that many who will be attracted by the occult theme of “The Man Who
         Was Born Again” may be unable to endure the brutalities and horrors of the earlier
         portion of the tale, since there are relatively few who are able to conceive a possible
         continuous scale of reality from the bestial to the spiritual.  It is usual to scorn
         either the one or the other.  Busson’s fantastic yarn may have its value if it should
         serve to suggest that perhaps the chain of relations from the lowest that we know
         to the highest that we feel may be unbroken.
