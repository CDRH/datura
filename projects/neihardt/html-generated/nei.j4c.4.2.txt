      <div class="salute">Dear Sterling: — </div>
      
      	
      <p>Here's my revised schedule: Arrive Palo Alto Feb 24th. Go to Carmel morning of the
         27th, which is Wednesday. Stay at Carmel until Friday evening or Saturday morning.
         "Do" San Francisco Saturday &amp; Sunday. (I want to hang around the ships, &amp; invade some
         second-hand bookstores with you, if you'll play Vergil for me in those fearsome regions.)
         Go to Berkeley Sunday evening. Go to San Francisco Tuesday morning. Take boat for
         Seattle Tuesday at 1 P. M.
      </p>
      	
      <p>Or, since Monterey is near Carmel (a recent discovery of mine!) perhaps you &amp; I could
         meet at Monterey Saturday, Feb 2. Drop me a line at 718 Webster St., Palo Alto, saying
         
         <del class="what">what</del>which plan suits you.
      </p>
