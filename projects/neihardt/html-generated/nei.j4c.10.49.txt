      <p>Those marked * can all be had in Everyman's Library, E.P. Dutton &amp; CO., N.Y., I think.
         It would be surer to order from Brenatno's, N.Y., stating that you want the cheapest
         edition available. # can be gotten in Macmillan's Pocket Classics (48 cents). Here
         is another one overlooked when I copied the list. It is a very fine thing for stories
         of heroism 
         <u>in exploration on land:</u>

      <p>I have not seen the "Magellan" listen above, but it must be a perfect corker. The
         material itself is so wonderful that I doubt if anyone could really spoil it. And
         the fact that a man would choose to write of Magellan would seem to indicate some
         ability to appreciate hte magic that is in the stuff. I'm going to have it right away.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>The above will hold you for a while. If you want to an extended list, I can make one
         at any time, and I'd love to do it. But there's bully stuff in the above. I like the
         way you are apparently going after those youngsters. Learning can be made a great
         joy, and so often it's made dull.

      <p>This done in a great hurry, off-hand can go deeper with a little thought. Wanted to
         hurry.
