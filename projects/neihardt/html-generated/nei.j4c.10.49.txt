<span class="salute">Dear Comrade:-</span>

<p>Here a list:</p>
<ul><li>
*Herman Melville: Moby Dick
</li><li>
*Dana: Two Years Before the Mast
</li><li>
Arthur S. Hildebrand: Magellan (a romantic biography)
</li><li>
*William Clark Russell: John Hadsworth, Chief Mate.
</li><li>Alfred Noyes: Drake. Frederick A. Stokes &amp; Co., N.Y.
</li><li>
*Frederick Marryat. Mr. Midshipman Easy.
</li><li>
Masefield: Dauber. Macmillan
</li><li>
L. Frank Tooker. The Middle Passage. Century Co.<div class="note">(stirring sea tale)</div>
</li><li>
#Stevenson: Kidnapped
</li><li>
G.K. Chesterton: The Ballad of the White Horse.<div class="note">separate <u>volume</u> the heroic <u>mood</u></div> Lepanto.
The Last Hero. (The last two in volume entitled "Poems")
John Lane CO., N.Y. publishes his stuff in America.
</li></ul>
<p>Those marked * can all be had in Everyman's Library, E.P. Dutton &amp; CO., N.Y., I think. It would be surer to order from Brenatno's, N.Y., stating that you want the cheapest edition available. # can be gotten in Macmillan's Pocket Classics (48 cents). Here is another one overlooked when I copied the list. It is a very fine thing for stories of heroism <u>in exploration on land:</u></p>

<p>Henry Newbolt: The Book of the Long Trail. Longmans, Green &amp; Co., N.Y.</p>

<p>I have not seen the "Magellan" listen above, but it must be a perfect corker. The material itself is so wonderful that I doubt if anyone could really spoil it. And the fact that a man would choose to write of Magellan would seem to indicate some ability to appreciate hte magic that is in the stuff. I'm going to have it right away.</p>

<p>The above will hold you for a while. If you want to an extended list, I can make one at any time, and I'd love to do it. But there's bully stuff in the above. I like the way you are apparently going after those youngsters. Learning can be made a great joy, and so often it's made dull.</p>

<span class="salute">Endless love,</span>

<br/>Jno
</span>
<p>This done in a great hurry, off-hand can go deeper with a little thought. Wanted to hurry.</p>
