      <div class="salute">Dear Mr. &amp; Mrs. Seymour: </div>
      
      
      <p>Our youngest daughter, Alice, will go to Chicago this week, and I have asked her to
         get acquainted with you. I know she will like you, and I feel that you will like her.
         Allowing generously for parental prejudice, she is as fine a person as I know. If
         she meets you two, she will have the feeling of your kindness and strength to carry
         with her in her first independent adventure. You may remember that I spoke to you
         of her work in ballet — four strenuous years of it — now. She has appeared several
         times with the opera ballet at the Municipal Auditorium

         in St. Louis, and has attracted attention. Now her teacher, Madame Cassan, is sending
         her to a teacher in Chicago who will undertake to place her.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>Alice was one of my boys until she went "all out" for being a young lady! Her sister,
         Hilda, was another — and she was married here last Saturday! I wish you could see
         those two girls handling Indian horses! Surely the Indian boys were flabbergasted.
      </p>
      
      
      <p>I don't know when I may see you again, but I hope it may not be too long.</p>
      
      
      <p>Anyway, let Alice know you.</p>
