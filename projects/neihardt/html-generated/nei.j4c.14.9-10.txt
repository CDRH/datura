      <p>No indeed, I am not wise, if by wisdom is meant the ability to be happy. Many readers
         of my daily stuff, and especially when I "let loose", seem to think that I do see
         causes and relations with more than the usual clarity. Also, I feel things that prove
         to be true, and in my journalism I have been several years ahead - in some cases fifteen
         - of the next swerving of the current. If this constitutes wisdom, I may have some.
         But I doubt the practical value of understanding basic things in a civilization like
         ours; for one who understands at all must feel practically convinced that, in the
         long run, terrible catastrophe is the price. My little article was not on life. It's
         title, as I remember, reads "Is 
      </p>
      <p> the Truth Bitter?" I know that the truth, which is a matter of just relations as
         determined by human experiece, is not in itself bitter. It is beautiful and wonderful
         and worth suffering to know in any form. But if I were asked if life is bitter, I'd
         be compelled to say, 
      </p>
      <p>
         <del class="that">that</del>
      </p>
      <p> if I felt compelled to answer, that life in our industrial society is, for the vast
         majority, already of no worth, and I believe it will become for the vast majority
         a positive burden. Increasing activity with decreasing human meaning is the chief
         characteristic of our society. I am unfortunately placed in a position like this,
         for a great newspaper, and especially my job on such a paper, is a focussing point
         for every phrase of the contemporary consciousness, and the impact is terrible. But
         I love you and some others, and 
         
         
      </p>
      <h6 class="fw">10</h6>
      <p>
         it is the ample truth that I could love anyone 
      </p>
      <p>
         <del class="or anythin">or anythin</del>
      </p>
      <p> sincerely if the need for my love should arise.</p>
      
      
      <p>I'm glad about your magazine. Silence is perhaps the answer that a god would give
         to all this turmoil and folly; but we are not gods, and the best our writing can do
         is to act as a cry to forlorn individuals here and there in the growing darkness -
         "Here too am I - and puzzled and still believing desperately that there are real human
         values to be cherished even in utter loneliness".

      <p>All of us were genuinely glad to hear of Mary's happiness. I know her husband must
         be a man of fine abilities, as this is a matter of common knowledge. That he is also
         the sort of man you can approve is better still. Don't let the race bother you even
         subconsciously - that, of course, is nonsense. The difference between the flower of
         the race and the kike is beyond measure, as I know from meeting  both types. What
         a really stirring and satisfying experience Mary must be having with him in his success!
         And what grace she can add to his triumphs! She has our most affectionate thoughts.
