      <h3>ANOTHER MUIR BOOK</h3>
      
      <h4>Muir, John.  A Thousand Mile Walk to the Gulf.  Houghton.  $2.50.</h4>
      
      <p>IT WILL be remembered by those who have read Muir’s “Story of My Boyhood and Youth”
         and “My First Summer in the Sierra,” that a large gap existed between the two volumes.
         Now, at length, the gap is bridged by the publication of Muir’s journal of a botanizing
         trip afoot from Indiana to Florida undertaken in the autumn of 1867.  Although the
         young naturalist had botanized along the shores of the great lakes in Wisconsin and
         Michigan previous to this southern excursion, it nevertheless may be said that his
         career began in earnest with this long pedestrian tour from Jeffersonville on the
         Ohio river through the forests of central Kentucky, over the Cumberland mountains
         and across Georgia to Savannah.  Then, for the first time, he displayed to the full
         what might, oddly enough perhaps, be called the gentle spirit of daring which was
         one of his chief characteristics to the end.  His route to the sea was purposely chosen
         through the least civilized parts of the states he crossed, and at that time it was
         far from safe to make such a trip, owing to the numerous bands of outlaws that infested
         the wilderness.  Muir’s narrative of his journey gives one the impression that he
         did not thoroughly appreciate the dangers of the undertaking, so absorbed was he in
         the beauties of nature along the way.
      </p>
      
      <p>From Savannah he took ship to Fernandina, Fla., and from there he struck fearlessly
         across the swamp lands to Cedar Keys on the west coast.  Here he was stricken with
         fever on the eve of his departure for the wildernesses of the Amazon and Orinoco.
         This proved to be a very fortunate circumstance, for he was not equipped to explore
         the tropical jungles, and had he attempted to do so the world doubtless would have
         been the poorer, lacking the memory of so great and unselfish a career.
      </p>
      
      <p>It was immediately after his Florida experience that he set out for California by
         way of the isthmus, arriving at San Francisco in April, 1868, at which point the journal
         ends.  But the editor, William Frederic Bade, has been able to furnish the last span
         of the bridge by excerpting from a letter a summary account of Muir’s first visit
         to the Yosemite, which takes the reader to the year 1869, when the “First Summer in
         the Sierra” begins.
      </p>
      
      <p>Considering that the journal here given to the world was written a half century ago,
         it might be inferred that the book is to be regarded as rather a juvenile attempt.
         But that is not the case.  Here is the same John Muir that thousands have learned
         to love and admire — the same courage, the same enthusiasm, the same wonderful devotion
         to science, and not a little of the remarkable literary quality that is to be found
         in the later works.
