And when we got to the house, his aunt said ""Well, Blunt did you break the sad news to Grace about to-morrow morning. I guess she'll survive all right but I don't know about you."" Now what do you think about that? Well, Margie, not a word, but I think Blunt really does like me, from all the things he has said, as well as things Kay & her aunt say. Well I know.
