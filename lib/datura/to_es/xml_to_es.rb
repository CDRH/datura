#   this file provides defaults for ALL of the collections included
#   in the API and changing it could alter dozens of sites unexpectedly!
# PLEASE RUN LOADS OF TESTS AFTER A CHANGE BEFORE PUSHING TO PRODUCTION

# WHAT IS THIS FILE?
#   This file sets up default behavior for working with xpaths
#   for multiple XML file types being transformed to ES
#   For example, TEI and VRA

# Refer to the specific [type]_to_es.rb files for more information
# about altering their behavior, customizing xpaths, etc

  # parent_xml is used for parsing things like personographies
  # where a single XML file may represent multiple documents
  # and passing only the child elements through will not be
  # sufficient to populate all of the data from the file in ES
