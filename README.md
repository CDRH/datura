# Datura

Welcome to the documentation for Datura, a gem dedicated to transforming and posting data sources from CDRH projects.  This gem is intended to be used with a collection containing TEI, VRA, CSVs, and more.

Looking for information about how to post documents? Check out the
[documentation for posting](/docs/3_manage/post.md).

## Install / Set Up Data Repo

Check that Ruby is installed, preferably 2.7.x or up. If you are using RVM, see the RVM section below. 

If your project already has a Gemfile, add the `gem "datura"` line. If not, create a new directory and add a file named `Gemfile` (no extension).

```
source "https://rubygems.org"

# fill in the latest available release for the tag
gem "datura", git: "https://github.com/CDRH/datura.git", tag: "v0.0.0"
```

If this is the first datura repository on your machine, install saxon as a system wide executable. [Saxon setup documentation](docs/4_developers/saxon.md).

Then, in the directory with the Gemfile, run the following:

```
gem install bundler
bundle install

bundle exec setup
```

The last step should add files and some basic directories. Have a look at the [setup instructions](/docs/1_setup/collection_setup.md) to learn how to add your files and start working with the data!

### RVM

[RVM](https://rvm.io/), or the Ruby Version Manager, is a handy way to manage multiple Ruby and Rails versions. Install RVM using instructions on the site, then add the following to your new Rails application, making sure to change the values for the Ruby version and app name:

```bash
echo 'ruby-x.x.x' > (app_name)/.ruby-version
echo '(app name)' > (app_name)/.ruby-gemset
cd (app name)
bundle install
```

CDRH Convention is to use the Datura version as the base for the gemset name, i.e.:

`v0.1.5` = `datura_015` in .ruby-gemset

## Local Development


Add this to your collection's Gemfile:

```
source 'https://rubygems.org'

gemspec path: '/path/to/local/datura/repo'
```

Then in your repo you can run:

```
bundle install
# create the gem package if the above doesn't work
gem install --local path/to/local/datura/pkg/datura-0.x.x.gem
```

You will need to recreate your gem package for some changes you make in Datura. From the DATURA directory, NOT your data repo directory, run:

```
bundle exec rake install
```

Note: You may also need to delete your `scripts/.xslt-datura` folder if you are making changes to the default Datura scripts.

## First Steps

Test it out by running the `about` command to view all your options (`bundle exec` may not be necessary, but it is recommended):

```
bundle exec about
```

To set up a brand new collection run:

```
bundle exec setup
```

Refer to the [documentation](docs) to learn more about how to configure your collection and about each of the scripts.

## Tests

```
bundle install
rake test
```
